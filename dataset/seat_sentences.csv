Review
I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment.
and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe.
BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline.
other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first.
"The seats are extremely uncomfortable,"
As we were checking I was told the flight was over booked and our seats wouldn't print onto the ticket for some reason.
We had already made sure the seats were booked when we had booked the flights nearly a year prior to going.
couldn't get seats.
they gave you wipes to clean your seat area yourself and we were split up so they could accommodate families.
"uncomfortable seats,"
Just a few of the issues: Required to purchase seats on international (Club World) business class.
"Given the very strange business class seating layout on BA A380s,"
leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family.
"I won't comment on the bizarre seating layout on the A380,"
as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating.
"The seats are not 6' 2"" long as stated on the BA website,"
"and I found the seats too short for my 6' 2"" height."
"the seat is just a normal economy seat,"
with the middle seat blocked off.
British Airways Business Class rows comprise of three seats with the middle seat empty.
aircraft not properly cleaned in Athens (there was full rubbish bag left in the seat pocket).
seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off.
The seats are not so comfortable.
The seat would not easily convert to a bed.
"The aisle seat felt like I was sitting in the aisle,"
there were backward facing seats.
The seats were not only uncomfortable but just so many things wrong with the configuration.
"This A321 has cramped business class seats,"
"No need to say anything much about the eight across seating as I know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years,"
I have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive.
"The seats I can forgive as they are being addressed,"
and suggested to move to a different seat which we slipped on purpose while checked in.
The back of the seat in front was dirty.
I had very little space at my seat.
Business class is just economy class with an empty middle seat.
"worn and dirty (there were crumbs of food on the seat and the floor from a previous flight),"
"It took 2 hours to for drinks service to reach my seat after take off - the food followed shortly,"
We booked early so probably had relatively cheap seats.
And the final insult in booking premium seats with BA is that you get charge £40 to pre reserve in Club and £70 in Premium Economy.
just 3 seats with the middle one blocked out.
Person in front of me put their seat back and my knees are in my chest.
I didn’t pay for international business class to get stuck in uncomfortable seats for 2 long flights.
"Row 12 so bulkhead seat and legroom excellent,"
"Seat itself could have more width (I kept bumping the VOD control and I'm quite slim),"
No USB power in seat which seems crazy in this day and age.
"tiny screen (folding out of armrest on bulkhead seats),"
000+ each) only to find BA want to charge an extra £80 each to choose our seats.
Awful seating with their Ying/Yang seating arranged like sardines in a tin.
"Poor cabin staff attitude - I asked for my seat to be made up into an bed only to be told ""We only do that in First class - if we did that for you we would have to do that for everyone in the cabin and we do not have the staff for that""."
"I was almost asleep when I was disturbed by food/drinks being passed through the serving hatch (otherwise known as a privacy screen) to the inner seat - This happened 3 times,"
The flight to SFO was ok seat wise as the plane was an A380 and I has reserved an aisle seat.
The flight back to the UK was worse since it was a Boeing 747 with the older bulkier seats.
You couldn't even get to the remote control hidden in the inside of the seat and I'm not big.
The recliner didn't work properly and the general space around the seat is cramped as the person next to me spilled over to my seat.
2-3-2 in business with some seats facing the cockpit and others the tail.
Because of the extra seat they cram into business now they are all very narrow and really uncomfortable.
"The food in business is average and the seating in the newer planes is terribly uncomfortable - and as for customer service,"
Seats dirty and no middle seat tray although business class.
The bizarre seating pattern that allows 8 business class seats across the width of the plane feels cramped and crowded compared to a herringbone arrangement.
found economy basic and the seat uncomfortable but enjoyed premium economy for the quieter cabin and more space.
better seat and a larger entertainment screen I really didn't see an upgrade in comparison to the huge extra cost.
"The seat was OK,"
"boarding sufficient food (there are a lot of seats in F),"
"seat comfort (OK,"
The cabin layout has 7 seats across whereas all the other 787's I have been on have 6.
"That means they are squeezing in another seat and it is very,"
So for me the seat was below my expectation.
"I was also amazed that I had to pay £190 to reserve seats,"
Seat excruciatingly uncomfortable and headphone that worked intermittently.
but downgraded me from Business to Economy and into a centre seat.
"but I was not entitled to any even token gesture of Frequent Flyer miles for the inconvenience of being downgraded and put in an aisle seat,"
"uncomfortable seats,"
very little seat recline and difficult to operate.
we were a family of 4 travelling together but split up and 3 of us were seated between two of the four toilets that serve 160 people.
These “premium economy” seats are directly outside the toilet doors which meant an entire night kept awake with the noise and light from the loos.
Air New Zealand and American Airlines - all of whom also allow seat selection without additional charge.
Seats on the 777-300 wear hard and uncomfortable including the beds on CLub.
outdated eight seats abreast.
"Seats hard and uncomfortable for sleeping,"
with the usual issue of having to climb over legs if in a window seat.
grubby tray between seats and ingrained dirt in the spokes of the seats.
"""  The seat was claustrophobic,"
"On board was no better a scrum at the boarding gate so not called first - was followed by a filthy seat,"
no separate check in no lounge but a $30 voucher to use in the one bar that is still open at this time of day again a filthy seat and a broken arm rest.
"even fully paying business class passengers have to purchase a seat (more than 24h) in advance (£21 for the frist row and £18 for the rest),"
My seat area was absolutely filthy.
same old menu but worse still people from economy taking the seats in business without upgrade or paying.
"BA have removed a toilet in economy within their A319 fleet to make space for seats in row 24 and 25 meaning there is only one economy toilet,"
My flight to Berlin was busy and the line for the sole toilet existed throughout the duration of the flight meaning the flight attendants couldn't offer an efficient trolley service and involved a continual display of other passengers weaving in and out of aisle seats.
Seat space and comfort seriously under par.
"seat with various malfunctioning or broken items,"
the seats terrible and now must be one of the poorest for long haul business class.
The big downside is that Club Europe sets remains stock standard economy seats - with the middle seat blocked off.
"staring in the face of my two new best friends (seats facing forward) was at best weird,"
Long queues for the bathroom (only one now for all of economy as the other was removed to provide 2 more seats) with slow buy on board service though at least they made it to the last row mainly down to little take up of food or drink.
"seats are old and tatty,"
"The food was passed across my neighbours seat to reach me,"
"The seats in First had crumbs on them on arrival,"
the Club seat just doesn't compare with rivals any more: it's way too narrow and storage space is dire.
"poor seats in a layout that defies any sense,"
poor food and very poor quality seats.
It seems to have been refreshed of late but this means rows of scruffy seats and toilets that are too few for the crowds.
"Seats were cramped,"
seat 11A an exit seat was fine however no service at all on board.
you should get a meal onboard (something I had counted on) and the seat next to you should be left empty.
nobody in Business Class had an empty seat next to them.
Cabin was tired and very shabby decor and seats inflight video system was ancient and had to be rebooted for it to work.
We had booked seats in the second row as we wanted a choice of hot meal - those at the rear of Club often have no option due to catering limitations.
"The seats,"
My most recent flight back I took an aisle seat for a change.
I find the aircraft consistently dirty and on this flight someone had left chewing gum on the seat as well.
"The quality of aircraft and seating is below other airlines,"
"Seat legroom is awful,"
"no difference in seating apart from the empty seat in the middle of three seats,"
paid for advanced seating allocation as did not want to travel facing the back of the aircraft.
"The system gave me only a single seat,"
as airport keeps some business class seats.
"at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me,"
I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats.
It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me.
Mumbai to Seattle via London Heathrow.
I did not expect to have to go searching for space because they had gear above my seat - and that I wanted them to shift their gear and provide me convenient overhead baggage space.
The seats are tight - I endorse all the concerns of the 2-4-2 configuration.
I have flown around the world in multiple business seats and the BA version is honestly the worst and most uncomfortable.
too few seats for the number of passengers and very poor food availability.
"A comment about the seats,"
"When the ying/yang seats were first introduced they were a revolution,"
I had a window seat and I felt very hemmed in.
All were kept on the floor or crammed down the side of the seat.
"with limited seating,"
Not allowed to choose our seats.
"8 seats per row in Business,"
50% of the seats don't have direct access to the aisle.
Checked in for my return flight online and to my surprise they charge for booking your seat before check in opening which I found strange being a business class passenger.
they refused to help me re-book any flights to Shanghai or reserve seats and promised everything would be sorted at the Heathrow BA service desk.
"problems with seat recline mechanism,"
Seats onboard A321 are a joke for business class with very small legroom / seat pitch.
"seats were torn,"
"Seats were ok,"
That's why on a recent flight from London to Brussels I couldn't face being crammed into a microscopic economy seat.
I was in seat 3D.
It was not a business class seat at all but an economy seat with almost zero legroom.
"I saw one of the cabin crew sitting in the galley playing solitaire on her I-pad whilst bottles and glasses remained at seats which then had to be hurriedly removed as the Captain announced ""cabin crew to seats for landing""."
I could not choose seat on line.
Unable to choose seat.
Although the cabin service and staff on all of our routes was exceptional the layout of the international business class seating is brutal!
Who designs seating where you have to either bother your fellow traveler to get out or climb over their feet?
They are nothing more than economy seats with the middle one blocked off.
"My husband is 6'4"" and I'm 5'10"" and our knees were jammed up against the seat in front of us."
My biggest complaint about British Airways is having to pay to reserve my seats!
there were no seats to choose from - and to my utter surprise my husband and I weren't even seated together.
The seating in business on the A380 is dire and the description given by another reviewer that it feels as if you are in a coffin is pretty accurate.
The Qantas business class seating is superb and just how all the other airlines should configure their seating on the A380.
"it would be impossible to book a seat,"
"The experience of the seats (with their weird coffin-like configuration,"
"Shame about the flight and the quite hideous seating: tight,"
The crew were indifferent and we were not escorted to our seats.
"I asked if the seat 2C,"
I had been allocated seat 3C and the allocation could not be changed.
Seat 2C remained empty.
"again because of the ridiculous seat forward/backward seat configuration in Business Class,"
that requires us or someone else to climb over us to get out of the seat during the flight.
New club seating is atrocious.
No better than economy with centre seat empty.
"Late take off due to mix up over economy seat allocations,"
Seat very uncomfortable.
Little legroom and too much recline available to seat in front.
There are 39 seats in premium economy and they had overbooked by 10.
There was a long queue of passengers in economy also who could not get seats.
They have offered us an economy seat on another airline with miserable compensation for a journey which would take 7 hours longer.
You used to get wider seats and more leg room than economy.
Same seats as economy but with middle seat blocked.
I wouldn't fly Club Europe again unless I was guaranteed this seat but to get it I would have to pay £18 per person each way on top of the club fares.
"No seats available on arrival,"
At 1m 80 my knees were against the seat in front.
"Seat is usual economy seat,"
service comfy seats and super in flight entertainment.
but despite paying the extra for Premium Economy the seats are like torture.
Bucharest to London Heathrow and the worst thing above all are the British Airways business class seats and the shocking lack of legroom.
Cramped into a space which is less than many economy seats.
Seat itself was comfortable and staff were good.
Seat area was genuinely filthy and had not been thoroughly cleaned with remnants of the toiletries bag between the seats from the last passengers.
Then a whole row of seats just stopped working so my seat was in a permanent 20 degree incline.
"Personally I'd have preferred to see some of the full fare business class passengers upgraded with staff passengers thankful for a seat,"
We spent extra money on upgrading our seats to Premium Economy and the service was appalling.
and we had booked a row of 4 seats so we could sleep one child one adult.
"Then we are told one of our seats has been moved,"
"actually your seat is broken nothing we can do,"
"This seat is in the middle,"
No other options and British Airways are not prepared to ask anyone to swap seats so we can sit 2 together on different rows.
Then the lamp on my childs seat malfunctioned and was on full beam the whole night flight keeping one of them awake - the attendents were unable to override the light - seriously.
"They did offer to seat my child at the front of the cabin in a different seat,"
On out outward flight from London to Vegas one of our seats also malfunctioned and the tv etc went down for the entire journey - nothing the cabin staff could do then either.
"After checking in online and paying an extra £45 each way per person to reserve seats after already paying over £4000 for our flights (wasn't a major issue and was expected),"
"we discovered that selecting our outgoing seats was fine,"
but our return seats had only 2 seats left both on opposite sides of the cabin.
and that it wasn't likely for us to be able to do anything because remaining seats would be left for business and first class travellers.
with tv screens the size of my iPhone and worn tatty seats with not as much leg room as other airlines we have flown premium economy.
The layout of the seating as has been commented on previously is very poor.
"except for the layout of the seats,"
Seats were not comfortable in that they were less roomy.
My immediate neighbour kept messing with his seat and was eventually moved as he said it would not recline.
Am definitely going back to Virgin Atlantic where Premium Economy seats are really roomy and comfortable and the staff friendly - even the ones at Newark.
"Don't bother paying extra to pre-book the seats,"
we paid £160 to reserve seats 12A/12B outward journey and seats 12G/12H return journey and never got what we paid for.
"On bringing the seat change to the attention of staff at BKK,"
"the footrest (attached to the seat in front) did not go all the way down resulting in an uncomfortable seating position and the rest of the aircraft and area was just very old,"
"Despite BA insisting that the seat pitch is the same as the A380,"
Not helped by the Multimedia box and seat legs of the seat in front in exactly the wrong place to stretch out.
"BA do not offer free pre-seating (unless you book this 24 hours before departure thus you cannot guarantee to be seated together if the flight is full or near full),"
"despite BA boarding by seat row numbers,"
light and airy with a very useful storage bin on the window seats.
"The seats are marginally wider than economy class,"
"a new boarding bass was issued for seat 1C,"
"Crumbs and mess around the bottom and edges of the seat,"
"The seats are basically the same as economy seats,"
"they just don't sit someone in the middle seat,"
but given the seats I wouldn't recommend spending the extra money for Club Europe.
Basically the flight is the same as long haul economy except no entertainment and the middle seat is left empty?
As far as I can tell there is no difference in legroom and seats are identical to economy.
"to the seat configuration and comfort (and cleanliness),"
Changed our seats to the final row.
Next day I contacted British Airways customer services online to ask why there was no indication at all on the aircraft seat plan that row 25 on A319 had no window.
The last flight BA117 on Wednesday 2 September 2015 the power failed meaning all the seats in my section of business class had to be manually positioned.
"seats etc were dirty and claustrophobic on this British Airways flight,"
enthusiastic to serve customers - and their business seats a lot more comfortable.
"The seats (that were introduced back in the era of the only BA boss to improve things) are cramped,"
"Because of the seat design,"
They changed our family seats without warning.
booked the ticket and reserved two seats together sitting together with husband.
Both babies are lap seat.
Two days before the flight I called the BA service to make sure our seats and ticket are all fine and got a positive answer.
On the day of boarding found out out seats are moved apart.
our family seats are arranged far apart.
"no escort to seat,"
no jacket hung up and the seat was dirty (covered in crumbs and other such food).
The seat would not lie flat and hard to move.
So on this flight I took advantage of a what I thought was a reasonably priced Club World ticket expecting the past 34 inch seat pitch.
Horrified to find on boarding that BA have reduced the seat pitch to 30 inch - exactly the same as in economy.
The presence of an empty middle seat and pathetic little table for your tablet computer is no compensation.
I sometimes go to Cyprus and the thought of a 4 hr+ flight in these cramped seats puts me off totally.
"however the only negative was the Business Class seats,"
in fact the tiny cramped seats was the only thing that BA should really change as it sort of killed an otherwise perfect journey.
They were standard Economy Class seats cramped in tight so your knees were pressing into the seat in front.
To convert these to Business Class seats all they did was put a fancy clip-in style armrest to make the row configuration 2 seats instead of 3.
why put economy seats in business class?
My seat (2K) was shockingly filthy.
"crumbs in seat folds/gaps and stained cover,"
"Cabin attendant offered me choice of the empty seats,"
"Seat was OK for comfort,"
"I found seat comfort mediocre in bed mode,"
Travelled from Venice to Gatwick on 28th May check in staff rude and unhelpful plane seats and food trays dirty and seats very worn and uncomfortable.
The cabin seating and equipment were tired - the entertainment system was old and barely functional.
The seating of 2/4/2 in a Business Cabin is unfair trying to pack too many people in.
Although having a seat on the plane only a few row down from the front some meal selections had run out.
If you have a window seat you have to straddle the person in the inside seat if you need to get out.
Indeed the business seats are smaller.
As a gold member I fly often business or first but the club world seats in the Dreamliner are really smaller and not comfortable at all.
I was sitting in window seat facing backwards which was fine.
The seat while sitting is comfortable enough although quite narrow.
There is little storage and it can be awkward getting in and out of the seat especially when you are on the window.
The problem was when the seat was in flat-bed mode.
The seat buckles in the middle.
As well the passenger next to me would slam his table and TV monitor shut throughout the flight and because of the design the seat you feel every movement.
To get comfortable I had to put the seat in more of a recline mode in order to sleep which defeats the whole purpose of a flat bed.
BA are charging a premium for this seat and they squeeze 8 across (compared to 4 for CX).
The seat is a real let down.
The seats were old and shabby and uncomfortable we were only offered bar service once on a 8/9 Hour flight!
On the way back my Husband and myself were given seats 2 rows apart at check in without being told.
The seat back TVs are very small and my TV didn't work properly and I couldn't even watch anything.
Business or club class is a total waste of money same seat as in economy.
No extra leg room or width no individual inflight entertainment and no seat power it's horrendous you may just as well book euro traveller.
Both seats had seen better days the covers of which were in places falling apart.
Several reasons: my seat in Business Class was noticeably filthy - crumbs on the seat and hair on my pillow.
As a customer paying nearly 10000 USD for a round trip ticket I shouldn't be afraid to speak to staff and highlight a dirty seat or food that is not cooked.
The seats on two of the legs were broken and my screen did not work on three of the legs.
We boarded on time and my seat was upstairs on the A380.
This aircraft is of course huge but the Club World seat is as many have noted much less comfortable than the Boeing 777 or 747.
It is narrower and whilst okay for seating very hard and difficult to find the right position for sleeping.
The journey other than the cramped seat issue again was fine with another good crew and food and drinks.
Seat narrow and table unusable for dinner unless use knee to hold it up!
The new seats are not very comfortable but I sat in the first row so had ample leg room.
Again the new seats are not comfortable - much prefer the old ones although the cabin does look very nice.
Chose an Aisle seat YYZ-LHR bad idea.
Seats are incredibly narrow not quite wide enough for my shoulders.
Tried to sleep but not possible with in-flight staff constantly leaning across me lowering the partition and speaking to the Window Seat passenger who appeared to be a BA staff member who was determined to drink all night.
Decided on a window seat for the return LHR-YYZ.
The flight boarded on time and priority was given to those flying in the premium cabin I proceeded onto the plane and was greated by the purser who showed me to my seat and took my coat.
The return flight to Heathrow was also very good the lounge at Alicante is typical of those in Spain rows of uncomfortable seating with inedible food offerings!
The seats must be the narrowest in class for any major airline.
On boarding I was neither shown to my seat nor addressed by name as I have been on other airlines.
In the air the level of discomfort rose as those in the inside seats were forced to jump over my out stretched legs and cabin staff leant over me to serve the inside seats.
Sagging shabby seats and no food except crisps.
Onboard after presenting my boarding pass I was given a grunted down there with no indication as to which side of the plane I was seated.
The narrow seat converted to a narrow and not very comfortable bed.
Flight to London was good with good service leather seats.
Aircraft a 747 was old and tatty and WT+ seats were rubbish in comparison to Virgin product that I have experienced.
"Seat back TV is same as economy namely 4"" across tiny but selection was ok and seats are fabric and didn't seem that much better than economy."
Return bags not tagged priority no priority boarding old aircraft rude staff cramped seating poor and cost cutting catering with no attempt at service beyond handing out.
Could not select seats on-line for return flight as computer had allocated them.
Eventually seats changed when called call centre - told couldn't be done for half an hour and strangely as the conversation moved forward they could do it.

To start with the seating arrangement is absurd.
The aisle and seat space are for pixies not real people.
Allow me to explain: The blue worn carpets padded fabric seats with stains worn out grey plastic panels with little grains of grit and dirt get into and a TFT which had the same image quality as VHS tape!
The plastic translucent slider that divides the seats had been battered from being shifted up and down when the crew serve the food and drinks.
Despite numerous requests many weeks in advance we didn't get seats together on the outbound journey.
The seats were uncomfortable the cabin was dirty and staff were surly.
The seats are just as uncomfortable the food was the same and I still felt like a second class citizen.
The whole cabin was very shabby and the seats were damaged and the TV set was unwatchable as the picture was so dark.
Even the staff apologised for the state of the cabin and seats so if it is so bad why do BA sell these seats.
I would be unlikely to book 1st class again with BA unless they would guarantee that the plane would have the updated seats and cabin.
The seats were old worn out and lumpy despite being in premium economy.
