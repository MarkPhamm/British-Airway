Review
"I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was,"
Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented.
The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate.
"The food I had was average,"
The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin.
I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board.
A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline.
"lounges food,"
The food is not much better.
uncomfortable seat and disgusting food.
club europe cramped and terrible food!
They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight.
The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish!
My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours.
Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec.
"reasonable food and drink options,"
Food was terrible as always with BA and only one choice available from advertised menu.
"I've not even mentioned the food but it was bad,"
She didn't have any food which we had pre booked also and she was sat right down the bottom end of the flight.
"sat in row 3 and told they had run out of food options,"
also for food purchased at Heathrow due to the flight delay and overnight hotel charges in Chicago.
"Food was poor,"
The food has been the worst part on our BA flights since the pandemic.
the food was tasteless.
On both outward journey BA015 on 12 February and return on 11 March we were last OR almost last to be served food.
On all flights there appeared to be an undue focus on curry/spicy food.
The food was so bad that most  turned down whatever the nasty offering was on the 2nd service.
This meant no pre-departure drinks and a limited selection of food.

Luckily my husband always carries chocolate bars with him as he is diabetic but heaven knows what might have happened had he needed food from the staff.
In summary World Traveller Plus is probably just about worth it for the extra comfort and space but don't get your expectations too high in terms of food and drink and be prepared for inconsistent inflight service.

The food - the food can only be described as truly awful!
To be honest I would be complaining if I received this standard of food in economy - the starter was a watery oily leek and potato soup and for the main two small lamb chops overdone in gravy with 6 tiny potatoes that deflated when pierced with a fork.

Non business class passengers used business class toilet and then helped themselves to the food.
The terrace lounge at Gatwick is outdated - no hot food apart from porridge (we checked in at 9.
The first one was OK but when it came to the second one when they got to me last row in the cabin they had run out of food and all they could offer me was a salad.
The food would have been good save what was on the main menu.
"The planes are usually dirty and if you get ""Bumped"" down to Economy the food is awful while the Cabin crew are mostly helpful and friendly you don't see them apart from meal time even when you use the call button where do they go and what and what are they doing?"
Judging back the food going up and down the aisle so did several others.
The food quality is generally pretty poor - especially on the Delhi to London leg.
The main dissatisfaction was the food - going out it was the worst that we had ever had in long haul and coming back it was not much better.
Food just OK but crew very good.
The food leaves a lot to be desired on BA I had the Salmon main course which was very bland.
I would definitely fly BA again but they do need to look into the quality of food and the seat configurations for future upgrades.
As a customer paying nearly 10000 USD for a round trip ticket I shouldn't be afraid to speak to staff and highlight a dirty seat or food that is not cooked.
Very little difference between First and Business in comfort terms and the food was disgusting.
Food: lots of cold cuts cheeses and some pastries.
Where BA fails: the poor quality of the food - extremely basic without any luxury items - not acceptable at all for a First product - IFE just ok.
Food on both legs awful but worse coming from SFO.
LIS-LHR leg was with a rather lacklustre and inattentive European fleet crew after the initial service of food and drinks further service consisted of clearing the dishes and on board sales.
At 11 am the Business Class food served was a plate cold cuts a roll and three thin slices of fruit (basically a make yourself sandwich on a plate).
comfortable with excellent drink selection and decent food selection including several good warm choices such as various curries.
Lunch service reminiscent of Economy food trays of the 80s too.
But worst of all the food!
The food was okay nothing to brag about and definitely not at the level expected to see in premium class (compared to the likes of Air France or Lufthansa).
The food was adequate but nothing special I've had equivalent meals in economy class on other airlines and other business class meals have far exceeded this!
One example that shows how pathetic it has become with cutbacks out of many problems I encountered on these routes is that the food was so awful on the Cancun flight recently that we merely asked for cheese and biscuits in business class to be told that we could only have one packet of two biscuits each as BA only allocated one packet per person.
Food was just terrible and how BA gets away with having pepper and salt in the cheapest of the cheapest sachets just baffles me.
Food was slightly better on this long flight but way below any other European carrier I flew.
BA lounges definitely stand out in the level of catering (food).
However the food was just cold cuts and salad - dessert thin slices of fruit.
"Food was from the Club World menu (WTP) seating fine enough wine good IFE but then landing late at LHR a delay because ""An airbus was at our spot""."
The food was terrible and they did not really want to serve any drinks unless they had too.
Lounge had hot breakfast and was quite big and food onboard was reasonable.
Food consisted of some finger sandwiches and a scone with jam.
These new seats have to go and food must improve.
Positives for this flight - good lounge in Singapore - the food has improved but it can be crowded.
One member of the flight crew was excellent and worthy of a gold star for maintaining good humour and excellent service Larger film selection than on the 747 Negatives - The food - awful - they've reduced the menu choices and the beef was inedible.
The food and beverages was to a very high standard.
I don't know what has happened to BA's food offering in WT+ but it has gone down hill recently the 2nd meal wasn't worth serving otherwise good service on a very nice aircraft.
The galleries lounge at Gatwick offers a terrible service - food normally consists of poorly made sandwiches pasta and other non discript offerings!
Cabin full so crew although quite experienced busy food options were gone fast and service not that great as in the past.
Food not good at all.
Return again same experience although a 777 good check in and security fast track - lounge ok with option to dine before flying which I took in case food was same disaster as flight in.
"Even the crew in first class have no idea what ""service"" means - I have to ask for things 2 or 3 times I am not offered anything unless I ask the food is inedible (they tried to serve me a poached egg which I could have played squash with) they ran out of bottled water in a flight out of LHR I cannot find any flights when I can use my free companion voucher or use my miles to upgrade."
Crew very good the seat PTV and food not the best on this flight.
At 0830 in the morning the tables were overflowing with used crockery and waste food.
Add in poor food and IFE and decision to avoid BA flights in future was made for me.
Sagging shabby seats and no food except crisps.
"On asking the receptionist where the food was I was told passengers normally use the much advertised ""pre-boarding supper"" facility."
No hot food was available.
Food was barely edible.
To get to the centre seats where my husband was - a dirty plastic ‘window’ had to be slid down and hot beverages and food had to be passed across the whole time encroaching on my personal space (what there was of it.
The food was badly presented and unappetising.
Add to that the economy meal was inedible (what did they do to the seafood curry).
Basic packaged food.
It started with a dirty dingy cramped lounge with very limited and low-quality food and drink selection and located very far from the boarding gates.
It took 1 hour for any drink or food service to start and we were served warm champagne and a small bag of stale nuts.
This was followed by a hot meal which was totally different from that described in the menu which had been handed out and this became apparent only when the food service began.
The food on BA85 LHR to YVR was atrocious - dried chicken sitting in a dubious brown 'sauce'.
Hardly suitable food for a long flight.
T5 Lounge overcrowded poor range of food rubbish and uncleared crockery and glasses everywhere - not particularly pleasant.
T5 Lounge overcrowded poor range of food rubbish and uncleared crockery and glasses everywhere - not particularly pleasant.
Food terrible crew and staff not friendly no drinks offered only when handing out food.
None of us could eat the food it was so bad.
Tasty food and wine very friendly cabin crew although the entertainment system isn't up to much in terms of choice.
The seat is comfortable so I slept all the way back rather than try their food and drink.
The overall impression is a dreary coffin-like space with minimal storage crummy entertainment average food and indifferent service.
Food choice was limited although I did enjoy the hot soup.
Food is well below par both in terms of quality and quantity.
I know BA is struggling to make ends meet but ultimately it has to appreciate that people paying for premium cabins expect a certain experience and the seat and food make up a major element of that experience.
"Service was not great and food was awful - ""welcome on board"" drink in Premium Economy was orange juice in round plastic carton."
"No idea what food was on offer as no menu provided and just a disgruntled ""chicken or beef"" response when asked stewardess."
Boring food surly crew dirty plane and expensive.
The plastic translucent slider that divides the seats had been battered from being shifted up and down when the crew serve the food and drinks.
The food was OK but again nothing special.
Food was grim my ten year old son who normally devours everything ate nothing on both legs of the trip.
A ten hour flight with travel at either end is a long time without food.
There seemed to be a hurry to serve the food throw a bottle of water at you and then shut down service until an hour before arrival.
Food was equivalently poor.
Food - I can't understand how they can get it so wrong.
On the return journey in world traveller plus not happy table broken and air steward very sarcastic food very bad plus stewards seemed as if they were doing you a favour.
Food was very poor with my steak ruined because it was swimming in grease (laughingly referred to as jus) which mixed with the hollandaise sauce to make a disgusting mess.
Galleries Lounge at the south end of T5 awful with poor food dirty furniture and smelly toilets.
Food and service very average as usual nowhere near the standards of international Business Class elsewhere.
Food almost non-existent on this 2310 departure and most people slept: this would be understandable if a proper breakfast was on offer.
Flight had run out of food.
Great lounge at Madrid flight boarding very good food awful service poor arrival at LCY good however baggage awful all bags through but mine priority last off!
Flew LCY to MAD in Business only 3 people in a cabin for 12 no welcome no pre take off drinks very poor service awful food warm drinks turbulence as we got in the air dealt with very well.
Food outbound from Gatwick was almost inedible and unbelievably they also ran out of choices.
At least food on return was slightly improved.
The food was below average.
The in-flight food was above average but not outstanding.
No facilities the food very poor both in quality and selection and had clearly been hanging around for some time.
The biggest gripe I have is the food on the business flight we had some sandwiches which were bordering on being stale and on the return trip was a cold chicken wrap which was very short on imagination.
Quite disappointed that the food appears to have gone downhill badly since our last flights.
Food from LHR was palatable and from YVR was awful.
Premium cabin is cramped and a fair distance away from the Toilets as you are not allowed to use the toilets at the front again cabin crew do no more than the minimum food just about acceptable.
Crew were cheerful and professional but the food would be considered business class standard on world class airlines.
I always travel EVA Air business but this time I had to get into BKK early having been told by many that BA Business is at best rubbish I decided to save some cash and go P/Economy seat no: 14A remarks on flight seating at best ok service seemed tired but the real downer was the food the plane was nowhere near full but by the time they got to me most of the food had gone and I was left with some sort of pasta dish - totally inedible.
The food as expected on any airplane was adequate though nothing to brag about (take advantage of the scones and clotted cream - their only saving grace).
The seats are just as uncomfortable the food was the same and I still felt like a second class citizen.
Remote lounge quiet nice food and wine.
Jumbo on way out new interior new and very good entertainment excellent attentive crew food as usual poor - (recommend you always eat at the airport which given cost of flight one really shouldn't have to).
When the plane was ready to take off then 1 hour later food ready to give out to other people then nothing until 1 hour before we land.
Upstairs cabin comfortable enough although the plane was old and tired IFE limited food appalling.
Food was below average.
"The food was ok but turning out a ""plastic pot"" upside down into the china bowl in front of you isn't that great."
Food was terrible -I have flown BA in economy business and first - and never had good or adequate quality food.
Her food was inedible.
To access the aisle from the window you have to climb over the legs of the person behind and the food is served across the lap of the aisle seat over the partition.
If you want to take the risk I travel BA to Tampa premium economy three times a year the food is disgusting and I always sit in aisle 14 now if anyone has booked there seat in this aisle be warned they run out of choices on the menu when they get to you and they offer you an economy meal and quite frankly they do not care if you complain well I complained!
So be aware that if you are seated in aisle 14 bring your own food because you will not get a decent meal.
The food was some strange fried rice which was bland.
The negatives were: very poor food selections on board (over cooked and uninspiring) very mixed crews - depending on what side of the aircraft you sat you got a totally different in-flight experience - some of the cabin crew should get new jobs as passengers are a severe inconvenience to them and the IFE was unreliable - on both flights the IFE had to be re-set at least once.
The Food is without doubt some of the worst I have had in Business anywhere poorly presented badly prepared and barely edible.
