7,True,03-2024,United Kingdom,A321,Business,2.0,A321,,1,False,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
14,True,03-2024,Australia,Boeing 777-300,Business,1.0,B777,,2,False,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
17,False,02-2024,Canada,,Business,1.0,,,1,False,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
94,True,10-2023,United Kingdom,,Solo Leisure,2.0,,,1,False,"I flew from Istanbul to London in Business class. For more than half of the flight a child was watching an iPad very loud with no phones plugged in - it was three rows in front of me and disrupted my flight as I could hear it above my headphones. Staff thought this was fine and refused to tell the mom to turn it down. Why is this acceptable on a flight especially in business class? Has this airline turned into a zoo? Are staff given no training in customer service? Why is a child allowed to disrupt other passengers? When I told the staff she just laughed at me. BA customer service is a disgrace. I've not even mentioned the food but it was bad, really bad."
102,True,07-2023,Australia,,Solo Leisure,1.0,,,1,False,"They downgraded me from business to premium economy. They took three months to get back to me and offered me 200 pounds or 400 AUD. The difference between business class and premium economy (which I never fly) is $3000 AUD and the difference between economy and business is $6500 AUD. They owe me at least 1500 pounds and to be very fair 3250 pounds. The downgrade was insulting and incredibly painful as I had a recent cancer operation and have a back injury which I have pointed out to them - I need to lie down. The wait for them to get around to me has been numbing. The insult of their offer has been the slap in the face to continue my degradation. The people I have dealt with at the airport have been down to earth, honest hard working people. The actual staff on the plane were warm and friendly - and helpful. The systems under which BA operates are some sort of medieval torture."
109,False,08-2023,United Kingdom,BA366,Couple Leisure,1.0,A366,,1,False,"Booked a very special holiday for me and my partner, September arrived and we were on our way to lovely South of France, Booked Business Class for us both to start the holiday right. As we were checking I was told the flight was over booked and our seats wouldn't print onto the ticket for some reason. We had already made sure the seats were booked when we had booked the flights nearly a year prior to going. Unfortunately when we arrived at the gate we were then told we would no longer be sat together and one of us would in fact have to go into economy. My girlfriend is an extremely nervous flyer and so had to take extra tablets to remain calm, She didn't have any food which we had pre booked also and she was sat right down the bottom end of the flight. We were held at the gate with another 4 or 5 couples all in the same predicament all due to the lovely money grabbing British Airways over booking the flight. They ended up refusing passengers in the end and even had people sat on the fold down chairs in the toilet area. When we eventually arrived in France late, we was waiting for our luggage to come. Our airtags stated that both our cases was in fact still in Heathrow. We then had to wait 4 days for them to eventually come into France by this point our holiday was ruined. British Airways was absolutely shocking, we couldn't speak to anyone as all the phone numbers were no longer in use. We felt stranded in a foreign country with no clothes and no one to help use with what to do next. Every day we watched them case not moved as we were tracking with air tags. it was so frustrating not being able to plan our days in hope we would get the call to then drive all the way back to the air port 2 hours each way to collect our cases. we ended up going out and buying new clothes toiletries and all the stuff to make the best of our ruined holiday, saving all the receipts thinking we would be able to claim it all back. how wrong I was. British airways take zero responsibility and fob me off with going through my insurance. British Airways only pay for basic essentials, Pants and toothpaste. I filed a complaint when I got back and requested my money back for business class and they haven't even had the decency to even respond. They are an absolute joke of a company and I wish they would remove British out of there name because there is nothing British about them. Do not give them your money, they cant even look after their staff let alone customers. Oh and don't bother trying to cancel your flight either as they just take all of your money off you and give you nothing back."
111,True,09-2023,United Kingdom,A320,Business,2.0,A320,,1,False,"BA standards continue to decline every time I fly with them. This time, a 45 min late departure, which seems the norm for BA, and no information from the rude and clueless boarding gate staff. The Club lounge was overcrowded, dirty and grubby and cleaning staff could not cope. How many more cutbacks is BA going to apply before they become truly low cost. As a 35 year veteran user of BA, while people complained of Alex Cruz cutting costs, the past 3 years has seen them decline very quickly under their latest CEO. One reads the occasional article about BA improving things, but I have yet to see anything substantive. There seem to be few British staff left amongst the cabin crew, so maybe time for a name change and give the flag carrier status to a proper low-cost - and sadly the staff service has declined year on year. Onboard, the catering remains poor and surprised that Do&Co can produce such rubbish meals when I have sampled their Turkish Airlines equivalent in August that was superb - guessing BA are too tight with their budget. Onboard WiFi service is a joke and should be avoided."
112,False,09-2023,United Kingdom,A320,Couple Leisure,2.0,A320,,1,False,"Awful. Business class check in queue just as long as for economy, probably because half of the desks were not staffed and Terminal 5 is chaotic. Business lounge overfull, couldn't get seats. Delayed flight, unmanaged chaos at the gate. No drink on boarding, first drink served an hour after take-off. The meal was poor, used to get better in economy on other airlines. British Airways has won the race to the bottom of the cheapskate stakes. Not looking forward to the flight home."
117,True,09-2023,United Kingdom,A321,Business,2.0,A321,,1,False,"One of the worst experiences on the worst airline. The flight was delayed due to earlier technical issues. The time slipped from 17:00 to 20:00 to 22:00 and finally cancelled. There was zero information given. Despite paying well over the odds for business class, we were booted out of the BA lounge two hours before the flight. When it was finally cancelled, the BA staff. Without explanation, told everyone to go to a gate. After another hour or so they made us re enter the UK via passport control, a further 40 minute wait. By now the airport was closing and there was no sign of our bags or any help from BA. A passing Gatwick engineer finally helped us locate the bags. BA completely washed their hands of us and in contravention of CAA rules refused to find us accommodation. Many slept in a bus stop overnight. There were people with young children who couldn’t find somewhere to stay and yet BA had closed down and left. The following day the replacement flight was also late and due to an admin mistake had no catering or liquids for a 2 1/2 hr flight. Overall the service was shockingly bad, the worst I have experienced from any airline. I will not ever use them again."
133,True,09-2023,United Kingdom,,Business,2.0,,,1,False,"Care and support shocking. Written by a previously loyal BA traveller. Lies and misleading unprofessional service. Told that my flight was cancelled. Booked on to next available flight in downgraded cabin from business to premium economy. Called to ask why. Told technical fault with my original flight. My suspicion was another reason. At airport, check in staff said that not enough crew to staff original flight earlier in day. Why take my money and allow me to book a flight which would have allowed me to get to work as a doctor in the first place! How can you trust such an organisation to look after you as a flying customer."
141,True,08-2023,United Kingdom,A320,Solo Leisure,1.0,A320,,1,False,"I flew London to Malaga on 27 August in Club Europe. We stood around at Gate B45 in Terminal 5 for over an hour, with staff giving very different reasons for the delay, late inbound aircraft etc - but the plane we boarded had been sitting there for more than an hour! After boarding, the captain stated that because they had changed planes there would be no meals served. This is Club Europe, and we received one small packet of crisps throughout the flight. No effort to apologise. We smelt the hot meal for pilots being heated and then saw it being served to them on a Club Europe meal tray. Cabin crew also had warmed pastries ( and were very quick to use air freshener in the front galley!) while customers received zilch. BA sent an email the following morning to say sorry - nothing else. What a complete and utter rip off by an airline that is already cutting back on so many things. I paid a full Business class fare, did not receive any part of the onboard meal service and they expect an email to be sufficient. Avoid BA if you have any other option nowadays, they are the worst in Europe."
143,True,08-2023,United Kingdom,A320,Couple Leisure,1.0,A320,,1,False,"Filthy plane, cabin staff ok, appalling customer service staff who couldn’t care less when dealing with a complaint. Paid extra for club Europe/business class. Food was poor, they gave you wipes to clean your seat area yourself and we were split up so they could accommodate families. Not really what you expect when you pay for the extra service. Will be cancelling our other bookings we have with BA, even if that means we lose our deposit."
144,True,08-2023,United Kingdom,A320,Business,2.0,A320,,2,False,"Chaos at Terminal 5 with BA cancellations and delays, and staff give different reasons depending on who you ask. 9 out 10 answers were lies. Sadly, BA airport standards at T5 are worse than ever, and we are long past being able to use Covid as an excuse. As a short haul club Europe trip, I expect very little from BA any more, and they barely even provide that, with cutbacks during Covid that are now permanent. If you can find an alternative carrier on the same route, choose them rather than BA. Sadly, on my route BA have a monopoly."
174,True,07-2023,United Kingdom,,Family Leisure,1.0,,,1,False,"Customer Service does not exist. One world emerald, frequent long haul flyer (including BA) - never seen such poor customer service or “computer says no”. Official BA.com site said all morning and afternoon that flight from Gatwick, delayed 2 hours. Delayed leaving for airport -only for BA to change back to original time. Called BA customer service 1.5 hours prior from highway saying situation - told not to worry, would note and flight rebooked if issue but go to airport. Got to airport 40 mins prior told could not board and that staff did not work for BA so could not help. Back on phone, 3 hours in total to be told could be rebooked, then couldn’t be, round and round. Ultimately told to file complaint. Then found out flight left 2 hours delayed. Paid for extra hotels flights with more competent airlines and now told 38 days wait for complaints to be responded to - heavens help economy and non-status flyers if that’s what the front end of the plane gets!"
176,False,06-2023,United Kingdom,A380,Solo Leisure,1.0,A380,,1,False,"Our A380 developed a fault taxiing to the runway - we returned to the gate only to then have the flight cancelled about 3 hours later due to a technical fault. All the while, BA staff were virtually non-existent, it was finally the captain who announced the flight was cancelled. BA provided an alternative the next day involving a connection but it was very much take this or else you were on your own. No arrangements or help made with overnight accommodation or transport,  Finally managed to get the legal minimum £520 compensation out of BA for the 26 hour delay they caused to my journey, and expenses were reimbursed too, but even this took four weeks. The fact that as a Business Class customer BA pays the minimum they can get away with says it all - they couldn't care less about customers, have no interest in loyalty and aren't bothered about your business. Given its our flights that pay BA's way, I'd suggest to anyone they take their hard earned cash to another airline who might at least care less about their customers. Not recommended."
206,True,06-2023,United Kingdom,,Business,1.0,,,1,False,Terrible. I have traveled twice with them this year via business class and they have been significantly delayed or cancellations with connecting flights. The customer service or complete lack of it is appalling and has forced me to change credit cards as I no longer intend to use BA for any further flights. Terrible uncomfy old planes and miserable staff.
226,True,05-2023,United Kingdom,A320 Finnair,Business,2.0,A320,,1,False,". The BA first lounge at Terminal 5 was a  zoo at 2pm, dirty tables and used tableware everywhere. Worse than this, the usual atrocious boarding gate service, and boarding started 50 mins late. The flight was operated by a Finnair A320, which is barely low cost standard let alone business class. Hard, thin, uncomfortable seats, poor legroom and the cabin was simply tatty - I remain shocked that BA allow this, and it's time for BA's CEO and management focused on standards rather than bean counting. Finnair cabin staff were fundamentally courteous, but they provide a very trimmed down, budget airline type service, as the whole trip turned out to be - and yet this business class ticket was one of the more expensive on recent trips. I thought post Covid that BA were better for a few months, but with the many cost cuts they are making, they fall well below all other European full service Airlines."
242,True,04-2023,Canada,Boeing 777,Family Leisure,2.0,B777,,1,False,"Had the worst experience. The flight from London to Toronto got delayed and we missed the connecting flight to Halifax. We were four including an infant and a toddler aged 4 years, despite being delayed and missed the connecting flight the ground staff were not at all helpful. We waited for an hour to get them to talk to us and at 12 am they told us they have not booked any hotel for us to stay that night and asked to go search for a hotel on your own, very nice of you British Airways. At least you guys should have given some consideration to the travelers who travel with children and booked some accommodation. We will NOT to travel on this airline again."
260,True,04-2023,United Kingdom,Boeing 787,Business,2.0,B787,,3,False,"Obviously many airlines have gone downhill in recent years. Prices have increased and services have gone down. The most disappointing thing about BA is that aspects that really don’t need to get worse have. The check in staff at Heathrow are downright rude and abusive, shouting at passengers to line here and there and rolling their eyes if passengers get confused with the constant shouting and bullying. Airlines are now competing globally more and more and this behaviour is particularly noticeable in Asia where the service industry is next level. I wouldn’t want to suggest that all the staff are like this and many younger employees are polite and helpful. However there were a couple of older staff that were downright rude and obnoxious."
327,True,01-2023,United States,"A320, A380",Family Leisure,1.0,A320,A380,1,False,"Probably the worst business class experience I've ever had on an airline. Just a few of the issues: Required to purchase seats on international (Club World) business class. This was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional $600 on a single leg (LHR-LAX) for a family of four. Given the very strange business class seating layout on BA A380s, leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family. Ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft. On my VIE-LHR leg, the boarding time for the A320 was over 50 minutes long, leading to a delayed departure. There was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times. Severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite C of terminal 5 at Heathrow. Boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding (I have no idea why not) and so crowding was extreme. The overall boarding area was far too small for an A380, and I believe this satellite was designed and built after the first A380s were delivered. Online check-in in advance of flights appears to be completely broken. I was urged repeatedly (on the BA website, and via email and text) to ""upload my COVID documents"" even though, at the end of 2022, there are no COVID documents required for travel. After I filled in basic contact information on the website - and did not upload any ""COVID documentation"" - I was informed (several hours later) that my ""COVID documents have been verified"". I then received another text message urging me to ""upload my COVID documentation"". On the VIE-LHR leg, the shop.ba.com page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times - over six hours, and then four hours just before landing. BA lounges for Club Europe and Club World at Heathrow are often seriously overcrowded. Furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty. That said, the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality. The food quality in BA lounges at Heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline. Onboard, food and beverage service was far below average for international business class. Terrible, one might say. On the LHR-LAX leg, there was no pre-meal beverage service and there were NO mid-flight beverage services at all. Unlike most business class offerings on other airlines, there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight. Meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off, with the ""chicken or fish?"" type of meal selection similar to economy class. There was no coffee or tea service after meals. Food quality was poor, with the pre-landing snack of a ""ploughman's lunch"" being downright disgusting. . There was no beverage or bar set-up in the galley areas - beverages available to passengers during the flight - as is standard on most international business class offerings. Even bottles of water seemed be hidden away, requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water. I won't comment on the bizarre seating layout on the A380, as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating. The seats are not 6' 2"" long as stated on the BA website, and I found the seats too short for my 6' 2"" height. The ""Priority"" luggage tags were not followed in the baggage delivery."
346,True,11-2022,Czech Republic,A320,Solo Leisure,2.0,A320,,1,False,"I flew from Prague to LHR. Excellent service, attentive staff, first drink service, then meal service (choice of three meals), later second drink service. In reality - excellent flight. Couple of days later I flew back from LHR to Prague. Boarding at LHR T5 was a total chaos. Onboard service cannot really be called service: No curtain between business and economy class (which later caused people endlessly passing to get to the toilet). Meal service could not get more unprofessional - 5 rows took two guys nearly 30 mins to serve. Constantly interrupted (no people passing to the toilets at this time yet). I don´t know if there was any meal choice as no one bothers talking to you. I was served that  afternoon tea consisting of three canapes-like bites and some drink. Why would we bother serving you also a scone. Hardly after 5 mins plates to be taken away - when I asked for my scone it came as a surprise I was not served any (no co-ordination between the crew).  Crew busy chatting at the galley. In reality - the service could not get any worse. One just must ask what do you pay the premium price for?"
382,True,09-2022,United States,A320-200,Solo Leisure,1.0,A320,,2,False,"The check-in process was smooth. I got access to the IGA Lounge which was nice, but not as nice has the Turkish Airlines Lounge. On board was what all this flight was about. This was my first time flying Intra-European Business Class, and though I was well prepared, I still found it underwhelming. First, the seat is just a normal economy seat, with the middle seat blocked off. There is no personal IFE, so basically no entertainment for a 3-hour flight. Meal service was very slow, and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin, one of the 2 choices ran out, plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal I got on my Turkish Airlines flight a few days ago. I could see that staff did their best, but since there were 32 business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley, there was so much they could do. Also, the 32 passengers shared one single WC, meaning a long line for the bath room, something I have rarely seen in business class. Arrived at LHR, we did not get a contact gate, but the thing was that there was no bus either, and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come. It finally came, of course, and the delay was more on the airport than the airline, but since BA is the main operator at Heathrow T5, such things will affect their reputation."
389,True,09-2022,United States,,Business,1.0,,,1,False,"London to Istanbul. British Airways Business Class rows comprise of three seats with the middle seat empty. Front rows about 5-7 are considered as Business Class, with very short leg space.  No pillows, no blanket, horrible inflight service, staff were harassing me.

They delay my transfer to the next day, okay, not too bothered as have my 48 hr negative covid test, but when I try to check in at Changi Airport, the Philippines Airlines check in staff require a 24 hr negative covid test. Had to rush to a different terminal, get tested, wait for the result, rush back to check in ...the gate had closed.  Had to book an extra night in Singapore hotel, book my own flight to Manila, then also the return journey back to London. If one misses one leg of a BA booked flight, the remaining flights get cancelled.  I discovered Oman Air Business Class and better then British Airways, from treating their customers, quality of service, the business class experience."
462,True,05-2022,United Kingdom,A320,Couple Leisure,2.0,A320,,2,False,"Very low standards for Club Europe: there was no cabin divider in the aircraft, so no privacy or separate cabin as would be expected, aircraft not properly cleaned in Athens (there was full rubbish bag left in the seat pocket). No in-flight information as the in flight maps have long disappeared from European routes which is a shame. Staff was attentive though and tried their best."

The good was the cabin crew who tried to make the trip as pleasant as possible. The bad was the in-flight entertainment, the screens were unwatchable when they worked, my wife’s didn’t, and post iPad era just don’t live up. The food was just about okay without being anything special but all served at once. Apparently the crew explained this is because of a shortage of staff. I’m afraid BA has a lot to do to regain its standing in the aviation world, the competition is too fierce now to sit on your laurels."
540,True,12-2021,United Kingdom,A319,Business,2.0,A319,,1,False,"In Glasgow one check in desk open. Huge queue with no business check in. It took me close to an hour to bagdrop. Getting onto the aircraft in Glasgow, no hello from the crew and the same getting off.  I normally find BA cabin crew very nice. Breakfast was a very tired looking croissant.  I used the BA lounge in Terminal 3. Not very keen on the new table service. Poor choice and miniscule portions. Lounge staff were very nice in both directions. On arrival at LHR there was a coach transfer from T5 to T3. We were packed in like sardines. So much for social distancing. The flight from LHR to Pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another 2hrs 30 mins. Captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage handlers to load the containers. No drinks or anything offered while we waited. Food was not even worth mentioning. As far as Club Europe goes it's not worth the extra cost. No priority baggage as mine were last onto the belt in Pisa, seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off. The first officer summed it up when we arrived in Pisa- Sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by BA, and he was right. For the return trip on Hogmanay we left on time. I've never been on a flight to or from Pisa which has left in time. Pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable. On board I gave the food a miss.  Heathrow back to Glasgow Flight left on time. Food was an antipasto of some sort which I declined.  Both cases were last off again. Club Europe is really not worth the money as you are in an economy cabin. I would have thought that BA would do more about their food and onboard service since the cabin is what it is."

Flight left 20 minutes late but made up time en route. There were 13 rows to the business class cabin on this A321. Service was ok but it was quite expensive for the product offered. It’s a long sector and the food wasn’t great. Drinks were ok but the staff kept going on about a lack of glassware, not really interested if I’m being honest when we’ve paid a lot of money for it. Staff were friendly and as responsive as they could be. Club Europe is fine for flights less than three hours but not for longer. The seats are not so comfortable. Not dreadful but something for BA to think about."

Fully aware of the covid safety restrictions at the moment, which the staff do an admirable job with - but nevertheless a lot to say on the state of BA First at the moment. Firstly - no lounge at all at Mexico City Terminal 2. There's a paid lounge, but the check in staff wouldn't help with the details. Mexico City Terminal 1 has functional lounges for AeroMexico working. Not good enough for an expensive ticket. Finally got to board and the staff are incredible - but throughout they were super apologetic as to what was to come. The food was literally inedible in First and staff offered commented as much every time. So for an 11 hour trip in First the option really was chocolate or crisps. The first suite on the flight had visible signs of wear and tear and needs some attention. The seat would not easily convert to a bed. It had scuff marks around it and generally looked a bit shabby. Again, not what you'd expect from a premium product. I left my watch on the flight in error and contacted BA immediately about this. Despite assurances that they have a comprehensive cleaning process during Covid my watch was never found. BA has outsourced their lost and found service to a separate company and in the process they have completely washed their hands on helping out customers. Given that I told them specifically where I'd left the watch I can only assume that one of the cleaning staff decided to keep it. All in all, you pay premium on a flight for additional service. BA isn't offering it at the moment. If it is essential that you have to fly really don't bother with first unless you have to - or go to another airline. The company just don't care."

This A321 has cramped business class seats, no middle table any more and frankly this is a pathetic premium cabin. Despite every statement they make about catering improvements, i simply refer to meal photos on this route in 2016 or 2017 to see they have severely cut back on meal portions and cost.

Especially considering the very high cost of the flight (I've paid half as much less for business class returns to Australia). We got off to a bad start when offered one third of a glass of champagne (about 2 cm in the bottom of the glass). My initial drink after take off was not what I ordered, when I queried it, I got a lecture on this was how it should be. No wine arrived with dinner, until I asked for it a second time (out of stock of the first choice), no second glass of wine offered. Yes, I could have used the call button, but 1/3 of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a 10 hour business class flight? Other than the initial bottle of water, and a glass of water with dinner, no other water was offered until I got up and went to the galley to ask. The good news is the food was good and well presented. Although the promised (on the menu) selection of pastries with breakfast were not served (I later walked past the galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast). We had dutifully filled in the pre-order card for breakfast, only to find we were being asked again at breakfast. Sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high, I actually thought I had a fever (I was so drenched in sweat) until I spoke to a colleague who was the same. I'm used to flying ultra long haul with Middle Eastern airlines, so I'm used to hot cabins, but this was crazy. Only when the crew dropped the temperature a few hours before landing (presumably to wake us up), was it bearable enough to sleep. Combined with the a very dry cabin air, it was very unpleasant. No need to say anything much about the eight across seating as I know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years, other than they are very cramped if sitting next to a window. I do like the semi-reclined position for take off and landing though. I have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive. There is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down. Being on the second aisle, we had to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembark, so it wasn't quick. At no point did any member of the cabin crew introduce themselves other than via a general PA announcement. The seats I can forgive as they are being addressed, but the service was budget airline level. Really BA, you need to do much, much better. The ground staff in Las Vegas were fast, friendly and efficient. The lounge was something from the dark ages, all 1970's wooden panels."

Flight attendants could not fix it, and suggested to move to a different seat which we slipped on purpose while checked in. The back of the seat in front was dirty. The tray on the 12D where I was moved to, had a hole on the right side, and the TV screen was not sensitive enough to be be operated by touch.

Usual cabin service except the staff were not the slightest bit interested in customer service and having paid a premium for business class realised it was such a waste of money. The breakfast standards (full English) are about the same as a charter flight standard, and despite what BA shout about, this has gone through some considerable cost cutting. BA can perform well on a good day, but it seems that cabin service is getting less consistent by the day - are staff preparing to go on strike as well since that is the attitude they displayed.

They seemed to be short on staff. However, what made me really angry was that there were people in the cabin who had had both drinks and food and were having their beds turned down before I’d even been offered a drink. The service was exceptionally poor. I am flying home tomorrow and am not looking forward to the flight. As a Gold card holder, you might have thought BA would check their frequent fliers are being looked after? I’ll return to using other airlines in the one world group for my long haul trips, such as Cathay, JAL or Finnair.

Tickets bought in August 2018 and decided to spoil ourselves with a Club Class return, having flown out Premium Economy. Arrived at airport to be told that we'd been downgraded to Premium Economy due to overbooking. Apologetic ground staff (defending the indefensible) but no apology on the plane. Fuming all the way back to London, exacerbated by hopeless cabin staff service (tea when I asked for coffee) and filthy food. Complained on return through BA exec Club webiste with response from Customer Service 10 days later. BA claims that overbooking is a very rare occurrence and gave a lukewarm apology. Evidence from ground staff on both journeys contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak season. We booked early so probably had relatively cheap seats. BA has presumably made money by selling our tickets to a higher bidder. General quality of BA service, food and wine has fallen dramatically over the last few years. BA is now effectively a low cost airline, flying a fleet of very tired aircraft, trying to preserve the gloss of a quality airline. The accountants may win in the short term but passengers will vote with their feet. Avoid this airline if you possible can. And the final insult in booking premium seats with BA is that you get charge £40 to pre reserve in Club and £70 in Premium Economy. BA, you are having a laugh with the flying public.

At BLR, no online check-in available and slow process. Plane decor extremely run down and shabby, various pieces of the interior trim (bulkheads etc) rattling  and latches for bassinet shelves not locking. Row 12 so bulkhead seat and legroom excellent, however this comes with the hassle of not being able to leave anything on the floor for takeoff and landing; the stowage racks are never big enough to hold the blanket and pillow provided. Seat itself could have more width (I kept bumping the VOD control and I'm quite slim), recline limited and footrest could extend more. No USB power in seat which seems crazy in this day and age. VOD itself is atrocious; tiny screen (folding out of armrest on bulkhead seats), low resolution, visible gridlines and very little choice (hardly the latest movies). To top it off, on outbound leg the VOD stopped working altogether and resisted many resets. Customer service forms were handed out so I await the outcome of that.

The food was disgusting for me, during the flight we were given a box with several pieces of junk food and shortly before landing given a piece of pizza. The choice of food leaves a lot to be desired. There were cold drinks offered regularly and you can go to the bulkhead to get extra if needed. We were offered maybe two hot drinks during the 12 hours on the plane (longer due to a delay leaving the UK). The flight back to the UK was worse since it was a Boeing 747 with the older bulkier seats. You couldn't even get to the remote control hidden in the inside of the seat and I'm not big. The recliner didn't work properly and the general space around the seat is cramped as the person next to me spilled over to my seat. I feel sorry for larger people. The food was just as bland and poor and barely any warm drinks. The staff seem challenged with certain situations. Next time I'm off to the US I will look for an alternative airline."

While the aircraft was new, the staff really could have cared less about the business guests. 2-3-2 in business with some seats facing the cockpit and others the tail. BA lost me as a traveler because the crew although polite, service wise was lacking. Pre-flight they offer you a beverage, I asked for rose champagne and I was told “I guess I have to go find a bottle and open one”. In my previous business class experiences there are beverages served every 2 hours, not on this almost 8 hour flight. I was served my main meal almost 2.5 hours after takeoff. You get one full hot meal and a snack one hour and a half before landing. You also get an initial beverage and then the next time a beverage is offered is 1.5 hours before landing. If you ask for anything else to drink in between you have to go into the galley. Yes they have the menu, linen, silverware and glass but you feel like they just have to do this for you and not like they want to do this for you. Because of the extra seat they cram into business now they are all very narrow and really uncomfortable. There was virtually no storage other than a small laptop droor and that’s it. I have to say the entertainment options were very good and there was no Wi-Fi on this flight. You get a pillow, duvet and blanket and a decent amenity kit. BA has the new planes, and decent business amenities however they lost me in the service. I will not pay to upgrade to business on BA and will avoid flying with them if I have another option.

Upon arrival in Shanghai I was not the only one from BA169 reporting missing luggage. Mine arrived 3 days later and the zip locking mechanism had been forced open and damaged beyond repair or further use. Nothing was missing, so was it subject to search as unaccompanied luggage? People deserve an answer when luggage arrives in that state. BA have not provided any explanation despite queries to Customer Relations; this is not acceptable.

The staff weren't that attentive so I felt like I got one much better meal with alcohol and then was pretty much left alone until an hour before the end of the flight.

My wife now very stressed and I arrive at the finger and when we could see that everyone was still there I asked the man on the desk about being closed and he said nonsense. My wife says thanks for the unnecessary stress. The guys on the desk were great and offered to push my chair which was actually quite a long way. The cabin layout has 7 seats across whereas all the other 787's I have been on have 6. That means they are squeezing in another seat and it is very, very narrow the cabin crew knocking my arm every time they passed by. Of course the 787 is a great aircraft. So for me the seat was below my expectation. I was also amazed that I had to pay £190 to reserve seats, I don't pay anything with other airlines. The food was just OK nothing exciting and the choice of films was not that great but then that is all personal choice.

Fine Cornish champagne was offered and happily quaffed. The seat was OK, but not in the same class as the new AC J class pods, and not close to the Emirate's suites. Small things like the menu presentation, boarding sufficient food (there are a lot of seats in F), seat comfort (OK, but nothing special) and the toilets (small and curiously offering single-ply paper). The crew were very friendly; the service was decent in delivery, but poor overall.

Additionally, we were a family of 4 travelling together but split up and 3 of us were seated between two of the four toilets that serve 160 people. These “premium economy” seats are directly outside the toilet doors which meant an entire night kept awake with the noise and light from the loos. Other airlines have toilet lights that dim until you lock the door to avoid flooding the cabin with light - not BA. Even the staff kept leaving the toilet doors open after they went in to blow their nose or check their teeth or makeup. This was the second leg on a flight from Sydney (via LAX) so we were beyond tired. When an attendant picked up my son’s water at the end of the very long and sleepless flight, he didn’t hear my son say “thanks” (which he had) so the attendant said pointedly “You’re welcome - rude!” and laughed about it with the passenger next to him. In my experience, better (and cheaper) premium economy can be found with Norwegian, Air New Zealand and American Airlines - all of whom also allow seat selection without additional charge.

Seats on the 777-300 wear hard and uncomfortable including the beds on CLub. Their lounge performance is very poor also with food option variety (in case of food allergies/intolerances) really bad and of poor quality. It is a shame Singapore Airlines doesn't fly to Brazil from the UK as they definitely offer top quality service especially on their business class. BA has become mean, greedy and indifferent to their customers and I feel it is time for the CEO to go as he is ruining the image of the airline. The changes on baggage weight has become silly also. I was allowed two luggages of 23kg. Any sensible person would allow me to pass with one luggage at 27kg and one of 10kg as I haven't go above the allowance I am entitled. Instead I had to reshuffle my contents from the big luggage to the small luggage to make it 23 and 14. In my opinion unnecessary as I had 37 kgs in total and not 47kg! So I will in future re-think my trips to Brazil. Even if I have to make my journey longer as I am after good service, value for money and a differentiated experience. Thumbs down to BA."

It's a diffcult one to review, some aspects of the travel were excellent and others unacceptable. We used points to travel, so what we paid was fine, though would never pay a full BA business short haul fee. We have family in Sweden so took 70kgs (gifts etc) of luggage with us for our four night trip. Check-in was fine both ends, all fights on-time (just about) and no luggage issues, a positive. The staff were friendly though clearly demoralised and actively encouraged to email/publish our concerns. We had a mixture of fortunes with the catering MAN-LHR, nice cold meat platter (30 min flight). LHR-GOT three dried up finger sandwiches, no alternative offered, were told could not take from the M&S menu in economy either. One reason for this, because we ordered an asian veg meal once years ago and apparently this stays on the system. I was told to change my profile details on BA site - once home I looked it clearly says meal options - none, i.e. no special menu (confusing to say the least). Thus the catering became an issue on the remaining three flights. We were told in economy you had to purchase everything, even water, however if in an emergency tap water could be provided - so much for a full-service airline! Any newspapers also gone from business class. On LHR-GOT route there was no divide put up between business and economy, so a 'free for all' to the front toilet. Leg room not great, even fully paying business class passengers have to purchase a seat (more than 24h) in advance (£21 for the frist row and £18 for the rest), which is ridiculous if you had paid £400 return. Lounges OK - preferred MAN to LHR (which is busy and looking worn already). The down-scaling of BA and the mix of pretending to be a full-service airline, but having budget airline ideals and practices is both confusing and not on. The FAs were a saving grace, though rest assured, they are not happy. We'll use up our existing points, though definiately not our airline of choice."

There was no such requirement on booking the tickets via BA's website and there was no notification of this by the airline at any stage. The requirement is not even on the front page of the embassy's website but well hidden under drop down menus. Usually when there are requirements like for ESTA for entry into US, BA sends a prompt. However, there was nothing in this case. BA had on its system that I (the other parent) had travelled BA already reach Johannesburg a day before. The BA counter staff at the airport refused to help my husband, who was travelling with a 4 and 7 year old with any alternative. Instead they directed to use the website to cancel tickets. After being given the wrong email address first, when finally managed to get in touch with customer relations, they refused to refund the ticket cost, only refunded taxes 25% of total. The overall service and the way it was dealt was extremely stressful at the airport and off-putting. They said they would use the complain to improve their processes but will not refund in excess of GBP 2k in tickets as they were cancelled prior to the flights upon refused boarding even the return flights and not within 24hrs of booking.

The meal and presentation is really a joke, and on my previous long haul biz trip I got better food in Lufthansa premium economy.

There was no breakfast (previously scrapped) with the cereal bar now also gone. Early arrival, a short wait for a shower in the North Lounge, followed by an ok breakfast. An early departure and an average flight on a A319. Long queues for the bathroom (only one now for all of economy as the other was removed to provide 2 more seats) with slow buy on board service though at least they made it to the last row mainly down to little take up of food or drink. Early arrival though a long wait for bags. Oslo to London on a A320 was verging on a farce, A full flight, selfish use of the overheads delayed departure whilst crew looked for space. The buy onboard came out quickly with one and then the second handheld machine dying at the first row served. Service ground to a halt whilst the crew tried to get either machine back into life, broke out the paper visa slips, took the cart back in, re-appeared 20 mins later so service started an hour into the flight. Little take up as people had given up including me as there was little time left to enjoy the purchases. The crew tried really hard, put a brave face on and kept going. The organisation and concept of the BA buy on board is a disgrace. Though a third party provides the food and card machines, the choice, stock holding and the reliability of payment machines means the service is a farce.  I don't understand why BA continue to struggle with this service as Easyjet, Ryanair and low cost carriers seem to have have to cracked it and got their act together. Early arrival and fast bags completed the flight. Final flight home to Toronto was good, the club lounge at the B gates remains quiet, clean and an oasis to relax and eat/drink before flying. The 787 was towed to the gate 45 mins before departure and was never going to leave on time. At the gate, the experience was enhanced with an upgrade to business class. Service was really slow on boarding I had to ask for champagne, and the underwhelming bag of toiletries and shades only offered after take off. We pushed back over 30 late. No signs of life from crew for another 30 mins, though a positive enhancement was tray service for drinks which felt more classy than a cart. The main of steak was excellent and looked to be on new crockery and plated after cooking (no dried gravy or potato around the edges). Afternoon tea remains underwhelming with no scones and only three sandwiches still wrapped in plastic. Overall, the decline in service seems to have stopped with some minor improvements. The crew on all four flights were pleasant but lacking confidence and experience. The desire to do things by the book results in slow and wooden service at times.

We were then informed by the overworked and tired flight attendant that no food had been delivered, although we 'might be' able to obtain food vouchers once we get to LCY. In short, the product was exactly the same as Economy class but at an added premium of at least the price of your regular economy ticket.

As it was around 20.30 uk time, I pressed the call button to ask for an after dinner drink for my colleagues and myself. After a 20 minute wait a surly disapproving stewardess arrived and gave us a dressing down essentially for still being awake and requiring service. Incorrect drinks were then brought. My colleague asked another steward who was across the cabin chatting to what appeared to be friends to correct the mistake but was told to wait. Eventually the correct drink was brought. I've written a letter of complaint but as yet no response from British Airways. I've flown BA a great deal and generally had a reasonable experience so it's disappointing to see the general direction the airline seem to be going. The company I was working for paid for the ticket so I don't know what it cost but don't imagine it was cheap. In their defence, I flew back with them from Delhi on a dreamliner a week later and the experience was fine so but the age of the plane does not excuse the staff."

What a disappointment, the aircraft was an old 747-400 badly in need of a refit. Cabin was tired and very shabby decor and seats inflight video system was ancient and had to be rebooted for it to work. This took until 40 minutes into flight snd kept jumping through flight. Staff were nice but no noticeable difference to economy. In fact the economy section on the refitted 747 on the return flight BA 296 was better than the premium offer on outward leg. To be honest BA had a cheek to charge for this supposed 'premium product' This was never an upgrade especially compared to the equivalent product on Virgin. To make matters worse the BA customer service reply to our issues raised was just not good enough just a standard corporate apology effort. With no regards for keeping future business. To be honest a poor service all round from our national carrier"

We travel in business class, whether long haul or in Europe, for a better experience. This is even more important now, since the quality of service in economy has nosedived under the 'stewardship' of Señor Cruz. It started badly when we discovered (once more) that the flight was not at the terminal, but in a remote location that required much waiting on a bus, just like a charter flight. I asked a staff member why this was so, to be told that the terminal was too small to cope, but I noticed low cost carrier Norwegian was parked on a jetty. We had booked seats in the second row as we wanted a choice of hot meal - those at the rear of Club often have no option due to catering limitations. Passengers were offered a choice of a curry, I think (yum) or salmon (yuck). By the time the nice crew got to us only salmon was left. This is high in potassium, a fish I must avoid. I asked why the other dish had run out by the second row? ""Only two were loaded"", was the reply. ""What; two only, for the whole of Club?"". ""Yes"". I asked what else was on board, only to be told that I would have to pay £3 for an M & S sandwich from economy. Before some help from our Avios, the tickets cost £500.00. It was beyond belief that an Executive card holder should be treated this way. The (very nice) cabin crew were excruciatingly embarrassed. BA should wake up before once loyal passengers swallow hard (pun) and migrate to other carriers. I'd rather fly easyJet and spend the £300 change on a nice meal."

I am ever increasingly disappointed with British Airways, the constant penny pinching is having a material affect not only on the hard product but the staff who seem dispirited. The seats, lounge food, aircraft cleanliness, on board food and beverages all are sub par compared to rival airlines. My most recent flight back I took an aisle seat for a change. The flight was quite full and there are a constant stream of people from the economy cabin coming through the business class cabin to use the toilets. This is really quite irritating especially during meal service. No attempt was made by the crew to stop this or even close the curtain splitting the cabins even after complaints. I find the aircraft consistently dirty and on this flight someone had left chewing gum on the seat as well. I think BA don't care, on the flight from Istanbul, electronic devices are banned, other airlines allow them up to boarding and then arrange for them to be taken off you. British Airways has not even bothered to offer entertainment, or even extra magazines on the flight. They really don't appear to give any care for their passengers even those flying business class."

Flight took off over 2 hours late with no real explanation why, and we were not kept informed. It seems BA is these days later in taking off. During the flight I felt like many of the staff serving were not friendly as one would expect in any flight let alone in business class, and my calls to request additional water or other quite basic service elements were not responded to with any friendliness or a service mindset. The main meal we were served was absolutely awful. It was supposed to be an Asian meal of a curry with prawns, but was just like gunge, and was not edible. I really don't know how they could have deemed this meal acceptable. Also the breakfast was far too late and seemed to be a big rush to try and complete the service before the plane landed - which seemed totally unnecessary. As I was hungry between courses I went to the galley to get snacks but the selection was poor, and the staff seemed to react badly to this for some reason. I have noticed a big difference of the snacks on offer in the past few years. I have been a BA silver member for many years but now see no reason to renew. I always try and fly Qatar where possible when going to Asia now, as the service is better and often the price too. There is nothing redeeming about BA."

This will definitely be my last time with British Airways, I have already changed my return ticket to Cathay Pacific. The business class experience with BA has suffered so much cost cutting they are well below every major competitor. Short flight to Heathrow and the afternoon snack was pitiful - probably worth about $3 at most. Seat legroom is awful, and not far off the 29 inch size that Economy is being cut to. Staff onboard were friendly, and that is all. Lounge at T5 was again very poor - crowded, food choice and standards like a cheap motorway café, dirty and nobody seemed to be cleaning. The toilet was disgusting. Evening departure to HKG and went back into the terminal to find something proper to eat. Onboard the BA club world product is lousy - cheap, low quality amenities, a very poor meal choice and standard, washrooms unstocked and quite dirty, the cabin worn and scruffy. As an expat living in Germany, I have remained loyal to BA until now, but this is the last time I will waste our company money using them. It is quite clear that BA are abusing their monopoly situation at Heathrow, cutting their own costs to boost shareholder returns without giving one thought to the longer term reputation (and profitability) of the airline. If you are undecided about choosing BA over another airline, quite simply do not consider BA - you will be very disappointed and feel cheated."
1834,False,03-2017,Canada,Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,1.0,B777,,1,False,"Toronto to Berlin via London on miles in a mix of classes. First class check in at Toronto was good with friendly staff. A fast priority security lane had me in the first lounge in 15 mins. Unfortunately first lounge was full (of gold card members) and so had to sit in the Biz lounge. Good menu to eat on the ground and decent selection of wine and beers. Fast boarding once it started and greeted at the door and taken to 2A. Excellent rose champagne served by friendly and professional crew. A weird but tasty starter of a cured / dried salmon followed by steak which was well cooked. Good cheeses and all courses selected were available. After some decent sleep, a fast breakfast served as late as possible ended a decent flight. T5 North lounge was packed with a 20 min wait for a shower which are now looking tatty and dirty. Decent breakfast selection of hot rolls, fruit, cereals etc. Quick board for the flight to Berlin. Ridiculous leg room -at 30 inches max. Very cramped. Don't like the table in the middle and several couples asked for them to be removed. An ok snack of cold meats though stingy portions. On time arrival and fast bags finished off a good and cramped outward leg. Returning to London in economy was possibly the worst short haul flight ever (including low cost airlines). A full A321 was cramped, insufficient bins (with one out of service) and the now infamous terrible leg room.(I understand this is to get even worse when BA moves to 180 pax on an A320 in line with charter and low cost carriers. Slow food and drink service with little take up. Some couldn't buy as no cash accepted. Not even juice, water and coffee offered for free. This penny pinching denying you even a glass of water makes the US and Canadian carriers look high class. The only saving grace were great crew who were embarrassed by the product they had to deliver. The whole plane looked fed up, subdued and just waiting for the hell to finish. Final leg to Toronto on a 777 included a bus mystery tour to a remote stand. Nice crew who were efficient and offered decent service. Poor lunch of roast chicken, weird mash and overcooked greens. Not Biz class food and pretty average. (more like economy food). Afternoon tea was fine, with a fast deplaning and bags. On the long haul legs, the IFE was identical to Christmas, poor choice, little new material - clearly even the IFE is now down graded. The biz class product - once cutting edge is in urgent need of a revamp if only to get rid of the 8 across and lack of privacy. How the mighty have fallen! Experiencing four classes on four legs, showed the gulf in all classes between BA and competitors on both short and long haul. The short haul legs to / from Berlin are worse than budget airlines where at least you know what you're getting and it's reflected in the fare and extras. With less leg room, fewer toilets, reduced quality and/or no refreshments, and a general downgrading of service, the only thing not reduced is the price. This suggests that the BA Exec and IAG only care about the bottom line and not the customer or reputation of a once world class airline. The only thing left to strip customers of is the Exec Club and Avios. It's only a matter of time before this final nail in the BA coffin hits the customer at which point - I'm off! Hello Star Alliance!"

Onward flight to St Lucia, paid for advanced seating allocation as did not want to travel facing the back of the aircraft. Tired, worn interior and the food reflected this too. Outbound crew were helpful and energetic, keen to assist where possible and were prompt to attend when the call button was used. Inbound flight was the same tired interior, unappealing menu and indifferent service. The only redeeming event was that my reading glasses and pen, left on board on the outbound flight were returned to me 5 days later when I travelled home. 10/10 to British Airways staff in St Lucia for managing this so well. I hope that BA will be renewing its fleet soon, it will not be my first choice of carrier for long haul travel until some investment has been made."
1856,False,03-2017,United Kingdom,Boeing 777,Business,2.0,B777,,1,False,"Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
1872,False,02-2017,United States,,Business,1.0,,,2,False,"Mumbai to Seattle via London Heathrow. I don't know why I chose to fly BA - a sense of nostalgia I think. Going to India this time, I decided to go east, via LHR and BA seemed a good idea. I will not do so again. I specifically booked all the flights through BA so as to avoid any issues with transitions between carriers e.g. having to pick up baggage en route. THe non BA flights were arranged (I discovered subsequently) with non-partnered airlines, with no instructions or PNR's - trying to find out what the PNR was in order to get a boarding pass was an adventure as BA checkin staff kept referring me to the next leg of the flight. ""We can't give you a boarding pass - its not a BA partnered airline"" - ""But BA did all the booking!"". Blank look and total non-helpfulness. ""Try in Heathrow"". I eventually phoned and got the PNR and checked myself in with a boarding pass. Similarly on the way back, there was no instruction to the point that BA wanted me to confirm my bags in Mumbai before getting on the LHR flight. When I got to the gate, the BA staff pulled me to the side and castigated me for not confirming my bags. The fact that no-one told me to do so seemed to be lost on them. Essentially despite BA being the travel agent here, it seems to be all the customers responsibility to know what to do. The flights out were not too bad - fairly empty business class, and staff were accordingly attentive, aside from the fact that they never had my first meal choice. On the way back - forget it. Firstly - no overhead luggage space because it was filled with BA stuff - it wasn't the 'for airline use only' at the front - it was row 11! When I asked them to shift that, I was met with resentful suggestions that I could find space elsewhere on the plane. I was pretty firm but polite on the point that having paid for business class, I did not expect to have to go searching for space because they had gear above my seat - and that I wanted them to shift their gear and provide me convenient overhead baggage space. Done with bad grace. They then essentially ignored me for the rest of the flight - an overnight request for a cup of tea (I skipped dinner to sleep) took 20 mins. The breakfast was truly awful - one of the worst airline meals I have ever had. The seats are tight - I endorse all the concerns of the 2-4-2 configuration. I'm 6 ft 5, but keep myself fit and I'm not fat. I have flown around the world in multiple business seats and the BA version is honestly the worst and most uncomfortable. Yes, its flat - but its short, and tight, and lumpy! Lufthansa, Ethihad, Emirates, Singapore, EVA, Thai, Cathay Pacific - all do much better than this - even Delta and American Airlines internationals are much better. Generally, the BA experience is unhelpful, uncomfortable and shabby. I'm embarrassed to have my birth nation offer such mediocre services. Its not because they are so much cheaper than others. Finally, I'm now sitting in one of the BA lounges at terminal 5, and noting that the provision of breakfast is geared towards buns, porridge, and muesli. What happened to the cooked breakfasts they offered four years ago? (the last time I flew BA). Overall - it's sad."
1923,False,01-2017,United Kingdom,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,1.0,B777,,2,False,"Heathrow to Hong Kong in Business Class on 3rd January as part of a holiday to New Zealand, also involving flights with Cathay Pacific and Malaysia Airlines. The flight to Hong Kong with British Airways showed up all that is bad about British Airways now and how far it has fallen behind other airlines. The continual penny pinching and poor staff attitude was evident throughout the flight. Check-in at Terminal 5 was chaotic, there having been a ""computer glitch"" which greatly slowed the check-in and bag drop processes. There were too few BA staff on hand to assist and those that were in evidence were being continually harassed. Business check-in was better but still very busy. BA needs to speed up bag drop urgently. Other airports allow you to print your own baggage labels and take your baggage straight to be loaded onto the conveyor belt where a member of staff checks the weight to make sure it is not too heavy, not perfect for all passengers but would considerably speed up the process for the vast majority of passengers who can check in easily. The lounge was a disappointment with tired dirty furniture, used dishes not being cleared, too few seats for the number of passengers and very poor food availability. Not a great place to rest before an 11 hour journey and I would concur with other comments about the deteriorating standards. Compare this to the other ""home"" lounges of other carriers such as those at Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur. Took a shower whilst waiting and that was OK. The flight was not good at all. Cabin crew showed general lack of interest throughout the flight and seemed interested in just getting the meals served and then disappearing from view for the rest of the flight until it was time for the meal service prior to landing. Gone are all the small (and not so small) touches that made flying with BA a pleasure, such as hanging up coats, hot towels, a second round of drinks, a nice meal at a leisurely pace and an overall feeling of being well looked after. A comment about the seats, how can BA justify 8 across in Business Class? When the ying/yang seats were first introduced they were a revolution, but a lot of other airlines now only have 6 across with a lot more space and comfort and in most cases you don't have to climb over another person to get out whilst they are sleeping. I had a window seat and I felt very hemmed in. There was no storage space for the things you need during a flight, glasses, tablet computer, water bottle etc. All were kept on the floor or crammed down the side of the seat. Sadly BA is no longer my airline of choice. I spent many years doing international business travel and when you saw the Union Flag on the tailfin at some distant airport you knew you were already nearly home. I saved a considerable number of Avios points for my retirement which I am now using up, but on other airlines within the One World Alliance where possible and who offer a far better product and actually look after their passengers and make them feel wanted. Sorry BA but you've lost my loyalty. Club World is now very poor (and also Club Europe now) and you've lost the plot to the bean counters. Never thought I'd say this but I've joined the ABBA club, anybody but BA."

Full, with limited seating, a forty minute wait for food, no available snacks and empty drinks cabinets. I left as hungry and thirsty as I arrived. No to worry though, British Airways will feed me onboard. Once onboard, for a two hour flight, I was served afternoon tea which consisted of three finger sandwiches, a scone and a really small slice of cake. This meal was completely insufficient. There was one drinks round offered and one top up offered. Given that BA use the smallest glasses possible, coupled with its love of miniature cans of lemonade, you will be thirsty. I found trading up to business class to be completely not worth the extra spend. After being disappointed by the outbound catering my disappointment was set to continue with the exact same afternoon tea meal served on my inbound flight. Staff were indifferent and spent most of their time chatting in galley."

It was better than my last trip in Club World, but having recently come off the back of an extended trip around Asia (not with BA), one quickly realises how sub-par most of the BA experience has become. Airport service at Heathrow distinctly average and economy style. Onboard, some staff friendly, some surly and frankly lazy. Loos were not checked or cleaned throughout the flight. While I don't fly to dine, this was more like pub grub compared to top first class airlines, and cost saving is clearly evident. IFE was okay.

Tiny PTV screen and poor movie selection. Crew was very friendly and helpful.

Booked a round trip from to London from Paris return with British Airways in business as had a separate ticket from Paris to Johannesburg (with AF in business class) and Cape Town to Paris (with Qatar in business class). On the outbound flight no issues apart from the appalling lounge in London T5. Checked in for my return flight online and to my surprise they charge for booking your seat before check in opening which I found strange being a business class passenger. The reason I chose the BA flight was that it was from the same airport (CDG) as where my flight from Cape Town via Doha arrived and after a long haul flight the last thing I wanted was to have any hassle with the connection to London. The plan was to get refreshed in the lounge, rest for few hours and get on the flight. Unfortunately, my plans were trashed when I arrived at the check in and was told that my flight had been cancelled and that I had been rebooked from Orly (which is an hour away). It didn't stop there, no transfer was provided and when asked how do I get there, the unfriendly reply was ""well, get a bus"". No indication of where. The woman simply turned away from me and started talking to a colleague. Tried to get some more information to which the reply was ""go online"". She gave me a paper which I thought would be a map to the bus but it turned out to be a sheet of guidelines on how to get compensation. Thought ok, at least something. The next shock, when I arrived in Orly. The check in lady told me that instead of business they had put me in economy! As I was very tired and just wanted to get home, agreed but asked if could still use the lounge. Oh no, not possible! At this point I was absolutely appalled and asked to speak to the manager. Was told that it was not possible and that I could go online and complain. Gave up and went through security to find out that the flight was delayed again. Spoke to the same lady who tried to ignore me and kept repeating ""go online, I don't care about BA"". When back home complained to customer services and got a reply that no compensation was due as they had ran out of staff to operate that flight. Complained again as had the paper from the CDG ground crew about compensation. Generic reply after 5 minutes was, no compensation. Needless to say, I will never fly with BA again which is a shame as do like other oneworld partners who I frequently fly with in business class and am a FF (luckily not of BA)."

However, this was blocked and upon enquiry to BA’s unhelpful Customer Contact centre, I was told it was a “random” security hold by airport authorities. When I questioned that the supervisor changed the story to one of needing ETA for travel to Canada. When I informed her that could not be the case as I was a dual UK-Canadian citizen, she changed the story to one of it being ascribed to the company but that it could not be changed because of the website. Only after repeated complaints did she bother to take my Canadian passport details and lift the block previously described as out of BA’s control. The second joy I had with lovely BA and staff was at Heathrow during transit. As I had a 6-hour layover I elected not to go to transit and to meet my parents instead at T5 arrivals. Upon entering departures, I was stopped by one of BA senior managers who forced me to check in my carry-on luggage (despite it being cleared by BA in Dubai) but was more than happy to let some other passengers with same sized carry on through. Perhaps she is the model random manager BA aspires to for future leadership. In any case, this “manager” was so eager to check by carry on in, that she left a whole bunch of company documentation with me at the check-in agents location. Such is the competency and class of this “manager” but then again one can expect no less from BA either. Finally, at Toronto, the checked in carry on came half-hour after the already delayed regular checked-in luggage – adding salt to wound. I flew to London from Dubai several times last year on Emirates, and on KLM/Delta/Air France to Toronto at multiple other times and never had any issues with security or carry-on from any of them. Finally, I called the UK ""Customer Relations"" center from Toronto, but I gave up about being put on hold for almost 7 minutes. They are incompetent and unhelpful in that field too.

At Manchester airport, the BA service desk were woefully under staffed and very unhelpful to customers. After a 2 hour queue, they refused to help me re-book any flights to Shanghai or reserve seats and promised everything would be sorted at the Heathrow BA service desk. I boarded the late flight to Manchester, hoping that BA Heathrow could help me with the connecting Virgin Atlantic flight when I arrived at Heathrow. This delay caused me to miss my connecting flight to Shanghai. My flight landed over 3 hours late in terminal 5 (Schedule 11:05, actual 14:06). Upon arrival at Heathrow (14:30), I proceeded to go to the BA service desk at Terminal 5 to find the next flights to Shanghai. After a 1 hour wait in the queue, the BA service personnel were not only unhelpful, but were extremely rude and aggressive towards me. They refused to help me book another flight to Shanghai, they refused to book me on a flight back to Manchester, they refused to help me retrieve my luggage, they refused to help me find a hotel and they refused to refund any of the £1814.60 air fare. I explained that I was now stranded in Heathrow with no other means of transport or accommodation and without my luggage, but they simply told me to leave the terminal as they would not be helping me any further. When I pleaded with the BA staff to move my return BA flight back to Manchester forwards to allow me to get home, the BA personnel called their manager to escort me out of the terminal so that I was no longer blocking other customers. At no point did they apologise for the delay or for the failure to help me and at no point did they acknowledge or appreciate the situation that I was in.  I was left outside Terminal 5 with no transport, no accommodation and no luggage. Eventually, after asking several helpful members of airport staff, I retrieved my luggage from Terminal 2. I organised myself a hotel in Heathrow at 20:00 after an exhausting 12 hours and now need to figure out how to get home."

The food was not even to economy standards, and the lack of choices in the lunch demonstrates pitiful money saving. Amenity kit second rate, the lavatory did not seem to be checked by crew from start to finish, and whilst the flight was quite empty in business, the service seemed to be on a go-slow. Staff (when they appeared in the cabin) were quite friendly, but they all seemed unhappy and quite ashamed of the poor facilities that BA now provide.

That's why on a recent flight from London to Brussels I couldn't face being crammed into a microscopic economy seat. Instead I decided to pay £385 to fly in British Airways ""Business"" class. What a mistake! On arrival to Heathrow's Terminal 5 I tried to enter the queue at zone B as directed by one of the information signs. I was told that the staff had decided to close that so I had to go somewhere else. I joined the queue at ""C"" instead but was told when I got to the front that business class checked in at H. I made my way to British Airways business class lounge, which was crowded, dirty with wet smelly bathrooms that looked more like a run-down bus station than an airline's lounge. The place was wildly understaffed which meant that there were used plates, cutlery and half eaten food littering tables in the room. It was far less crowed in the rest of the terminal which is where I waited for my flight. The gate was announced and I made my way to gate 10C where the flight was being bussed. I was in seat 3D. It was not a business class seat at all but an economy seat with almost zero legroom. The whole point of spending £385 was legroom and I didn't have any. I asked the flight attendant if anything could be done.  BA would not have been my choice anyway but I do understand that given tight schedules and limited choice sometime you are forced to fly with a particular company against your better judgment. In that case don't make the same mistake as me. British Airways."

Departure time was 0750 and we arrived at Premium Check-in at 0620 to find only one member of staff manning the desks serving First and Club. There were at least 10 parties waiting in the queue, some of whom defected to Economy desks which were heavily manned with faster moving queues. Only after more than 15 minutes did extra staff arrive and when we reached the desk the attitude of the Check-in lady left much to be desired - robotic, unsmiling and disinterested is probably a kind description. It would have been good to have been informed that the No 1 Lounge was available in the absence of the BA offering, but no mention of a lounge was made at all. The No 1 Lounge struggles to cope with the additional passenger load, but that is another story. Boarding was fine, but the in-flight service from a totally disinterested cabin crew was perfunctory at best. The meal service was late and slow with no drinks of any sort offered until after all meals had been dispensed. Clearing the meal was even worse. The flight was in final approach to Luqa when, returning from the toilet, I saw one of the cabin crew sitting in the galley playing solitaire on her I-pad whilst bottles and glasses remained at seats which then had to be hurriedly removed as the Captain announced ""cabin crew to seats for landing"". Should I have apologised for being a mere passenger interrupting this lady's games session? Appalling - and such a contrast to several LHR-PRG early morning flights over recent years when it has been a joy to fly BA. This may just have been a bad flight, but I fear that this is the future for BA unless somebody at the top reads these reports and takes remedial action before it's good name is lost forever."

I asked if the seat 2C, I had prebooked on the cancelled flight was available and was told no, I had been allocated seat 3C and the allocation could not be changed. Seat 2C remained empty. The business lounge was at least superior to the BA one I used on my outward journey, being independantly run. Our incoming flight for BA749 was delayed leaving Heathrow finally landing at 11.25PM. At 10:30pm passengers were informed by the business lounge Concierge that we must clear passport control and be in line at the gate by 11:00pm as the airport closes at midnight so a rapid turnround was needed. The flight eventually pushed back from the stand at 23:50. I wonder if this was a ploy by BA to avoid paying compensation for a 3 hour delay.

No better than economy with centre seat empty. No drink offered on boarding. Economy passagers access past club section via a very narrow aisle most carrying or dragging oversized cabin baggage. Late take off due to mix up over economy seat allocations, and late arrival of passengers needing wheelchair assistance. Seat very uncomfortable. Little legroom and too much recline available to seat in front. The only saving point was the cabin manager whose hardwork and helpfulness was not matched by her workshy crew.

There was a long queue of passengers in economy also who could not get seats. This is utterly irresponsible. Very few people book a long haul flight across the world and fail to show up without cancelling. We were told by the manager that this happens almost every night. Not a single employee of British Airways was there to manage the situation. It was left to the poor Malaysia Airlines handling staff as agents to try to deal with it. They have offered us an economy seat on another airline with miserable compensation for a journey which would take 7 hours longer. They refused reasonable requests to give us an upgrade on the way home or to offer any other form of compensation.

We kept the children together behind me, obviously meaning I could not sleep the whole flight and my husband was alone.

Getting onto the plane we were the first ones to be called up to board before economy which was good but getting onto the aircraft we discovered an extremely dated plane, with tv screens the size of my iPhone and worn tatty seats with not as much leg room as other airlines we have flown premium economy. After take off we were given a meal with the only option being chicken or beef which was okay, flight attendants then offered us drinks - once we had our drinks gave us at the same time two bottles of sparkling wine which we hadn't asked for and we were happy with, and thought that perhaps the service would make up for the dated flight. But then 5 hours into the flight we had seen absolutely no staff whatsoever and had soon discovered from overheard conversations that a lot of the onboard staff's family were on board and they were all staying in Punta Cana for 5 days before flying home. One member of staff appeared around 6 hours into the flight and gave their families and friends champagne from first class - and walked past everybody else.

Breakfast was a wholemeal croissant just out of the fridge - yuk. The British Airways check in staff at Newark are so surly and miserable. Whoever made the tanoy annoucements for boarding had an accent so that I could not distinguish what she was saying. On my outgoing trip and arrival at USA customs queue I realised that I did not have the customs entry form. Seems I should have been given one to complete by the BA check-in person. I had asked the flight attendants if there were any forms to be completed and they said they would check and get back to me. Never saw them again. Am definitely going back to Virgin Atlantic where Premium Economy seats are really roomy and comfortable and the staff friendly - even the ones at Newark."

On bringing the seat change to the attention of staff at BKK, was told sorry, system make a mistake. On a positive note the staff were working hard and water and juice was offered frequently on the day flight. The female staff on flight BA0010 looked as if the did not want to be there, very abrupt and surly looking. On the other hand the male staff on this flight were very professional, smiling and very attentive. British Airways need to work a bit harder and update the grubby fleet on this route as the Asian airlines offer a better product. Blankets shabby in business / premier elite. The inflight films / ancient music very limited. Come on BA wake up your losing customers and need to up your game. What was once a great airline is going downhill."

Both legs in WT+ (Premium Economy). The Boeing 747-400 is very tired aircraft who BA seemingly are not investing in at all. The plastic surrounding the blind was coming away, the footrest (attached to the seat in front) did not go all the way down resulting in an uncomfortable seating position and the rest of the aircraft and area was just very old, tired and tatty. Despite BA insisting that the seat pitch is the same as the A380, it felt far more cramped, and much more like normal WT (Economy). Not helped by the Multimedia box and seat legs of the seat in front in exactly the wrong place to stretch out. The TV screens are very small and an old square format with far more limited programming compared with the A380. On the meal service, they ran out of the beef choice half way around the cabin service leaving only a vegetarian option (the helpful cabin crew did eventually find one from business class as WT+ gets the business class entree) but only as they had one left over. I feel if you pay for a service (at near-as-makes-no-difference twice the price of WT) with the word ""Premium"" in the title you should expect a premium product. BA do not offer free pre-seating (unless you book this 24 hours before departure thus you cannot guarantee to be seated together if the flight is full or near full), priority check-in, priority boarding, the pre-take-off drink is orange juice or water on all inbound flights. Additionally, despite BA boarding by seat row numbers, this was ignored by most passengers and ground staff alike so by the time we were called to board, the WT+ cabin was already full with very limited room for our carry on luggage, so it lucky that we travel very light! As you can tell, overall I feel that this was a lot of money for very little in return. Based upon our experience, I would recommend the WT+ in the A380 but only when departing from the UK (you can pre-order your meal and they serve wine as a pre-take off). In addition, WT+ on the 380 is upstairs in a small, cosy cabin, light and airy with a very useful storage bin on the window seats. These may be small points on their own, but combine to take the shine off a very expensive upgrade."

Boarding was absolute mayhem with no separate call for business class or Oneworld members to board first. So I jumped on the bus to be called off and told the check-in agent had booked me in economy class row 8D, which was listed as business class at on-line check-in. After a wait of 10 minutes, a new boarding bass was issued for seat 1C, and the aircraft bus had to be called back to pick me up. Onboard things did improve and chatted with friendly crew.

The meal service has been much debated, and is served (rather pushed at you) on a cheap economy style format, and quality is on a par with JAL economy class I used in August. I'm British and like to support BA, but the honest fact is that BA have slipped right down against from the competition. My journey out was from Frankfurt on Lufthansa, an airline I probably wouldn't have used a few years ago, but their business class standards are so much higher.

The only redeeming feature of the whole experience was the staff at the Washington Dulles lounge, the rest of BA could learn a lot in there.

On return journey I checked in online as usual. Changed our seats to the final row. Got on board to find the row had no window. Flight too full to move elsewhere. Partner a very nervous flyer and had a horrible journey back, felt he was in a coffin, and heart flutter returned next day due to stress of the journey. All made worse by 30 min delay on departure and a further 30 min delay before being allowed to land at LHR. Next day I contacted British Airways customer services online to ask why there was no indication at all on the aircraft seat plan that row 25 on A319 had no window. No response at all apart from automated ""we're busy but will get back to you asap"". A week later I sent the same response, with original complaint number, again online. No response at all, not even the automated one. I'm left feeling that British Airways is now Ryanair, though even they have been trying to improve their service and image recently. The days of British Airways as a classic British airline, with good service and professionalism went with the sale of it to other nations. It is not what it appears. We also noted that cabin staff in economy could barely cope with a full cabin. Instead of a trolley starting at either end, there was only one with two staff. For the ""widest short range jet"" of 25 rows, 6 across this was not enough. Costs have been cut, clearly staff are demoralised and customer service has gone out of the window.

Too much money for such a mediocre service, aircraft that are many years beyond proper serviceability and a management team focused on shareholder profit not customer satisfaction. What a fall from grace. In August I flew Singapore Airlines London to Melbourne. What a difference in aircraft quality, customer service experience and value for money. Please British Airways, sort yourselves out. Letters to Keith Williams or Willie Walsh are ignored or intercepted by staff. Lots of promises and little or no action.

It is not the technical fault I am worried about but the way the problem was handled by BA's ground staff at Johannesburg's OR Tambo Airport. The cabin crew had arrived at 18.00hrs and boarded the plane which was due to depart at 19.20hrs to London. At 18.20hrs the announcement came that the flight was not boarding and passengers should wait to be escorted to the arrivals areas to collect baggage. The chaos then started. People close to the boarding desks sought to find out information and the possibility of alternative flights (which were fully booked). After about 40 minutes passengers were told to go to arrivals where BA staff would be there to assist. Got to arrivals, nobody was there to even tell passengers which carousel to go to. A series of late announcements then informed passengers to collect luggage and go to the arrivals area to seek hotel vouchers. Nobody was directing passengers at each stage. Passengers were congregating under an electronic sign that said South African Airways domestic transfers to collect vouchers. The line slinked back into the arrivals area. Only two service agents were dealing with all passengers. Chaotic scenes. No line for families or premium passengers. In the end no vouchers were given and free for all to just know which hotel to go to. No clear announcements given at any stage to passengers. All airlines have issues which mean a plane will be cancelled - it is how the issue is dealt with that shows professionalism and a basic duty of care to passengers. In this case there was nobody in charge, nobody undertaking line management and nobody providing one source of information. A true shambles. Passengers arrived at the hotel not knowing when the aircraft would leave (scheduled to leave 27 hrs after original departure) or what the real problem was (rumours only).

Food is basically on a par with many Asian airlines Economy class standards, and you need to be very cautious about believing any of the marketing rubbish that British Airways provide in different areas. This is not a premium experience, and was a true waste of money. Staff were on another planet as far as service was concerned - abrupt, unsmiling and intent on getting service over as quickly as possible, before they retired to gossip loudly in the galley. Using the call button was a waste of time midflight, I guess they were all resting by then. I know that on Air China the wine may be served rather warm, a cold beer is hard to get, and staff language skills are limited to standard phrases, but their staff are cheerful, enthusiastic to serve customers - and their business seats a lot more comfortable. The British Airways motto of flying to serve should be challenged in court as a blatant misrepresentation.

Airport service in Narita is always good - because it is not BA providing the service. But for the rest of the trip, simply awful. The seats (that were introduced back in the era of the only BA boss to improve things) are cramped, claustrophobic and very unpleasant on a long haul flight. Because of the seat design, there is an economy class meal style service rather than the table service that most of the ""good"" airlines now offer in Business class. The cabin staff were frankly laughable, sadly with the exception of a charming and attentive Japanese FA. British Airways is trading off a very distant reputation, and it seems that most British customers select them simply because they are British - anyone that travels a reasonable amount will know that BA is now well down the quality list, and it is about time Skytrax downgraded them to 3-Star Airline maximum - they do not meet 4-Star. BA markets itself as this slick, British style, when the reality is that they are a substandard member of oneworld now, and should be avoided if you have a proper choice of airline - many UK companies and UK departments stipulate BA as a No 1 choice, and frankly they are throwing their money down the pan. If you're proud to be British, I would recommend you give BA a wake-up call and avoid this very poor airline until they wake up and improve standards.

No food for my 2 year old. If we are not allowed to bring food onto the plane, what do BA expect baby can eat? No help from staff with any service.

No priority boarding, had to queue in the airbridge for 10 minutes, no greeting at the door, no escort to seat, no jacket hung up and the seat was dirty (covered in crumbs and other such food). Opened two magazines both torn, ripped and in rag order. Staff very pleasant, professional, and very helpful. Food ok not First class, wines good. The entertainment system was broken and kept rebooting itself. The seat would not lie flat and hard to move. Bought on board duty free and asked would I need a sealed bag to bring it through to my connection told yes. Deplaned, no escort, no gate to go to, given wrong directions to the lounge. Had to clear immigration although not entering the UK, waited 45 minutes to be told duty free I bought on board could not go through I would need to go to check in although told the opposite on board. This was done, had to reclear security again, got to the lounge asked for a shower, told too busy. Connection flight was delayed by one hour, waited at the gate. Flight to Dublin short, salad served and tea. Priority bags were the last bags on the belt. Overall this is not first class, it is not even premium economy. I fly 12-14 times a year and gold level. BA you have lost your edge, I will stay loyal to Qatar, Emirates and Cathay Pacfic whose consistent hard wear and soft product is worth the money and deserves my business.

Horrified to find on boarding that BA have reduced the seat pitch to 30 inch - exactly the same as in economy. The presence of an empty middle seat and pathetic little table for your tablet computer is no compensation. Fortunately this was a short flight but even so I was extremely uncomfortable. Cabin staff and other passengers said there had been loads of complaints but clearly BA don't care. I sometimes go to Cyprus and the thought of a 4 hr+ flight in these cramped seats puts me off totally. The meal was passable but as the flight took off a couple of minutes before midday it was classed as ""late breakfast"" and no wine was served. It is clear that BA are putting profit over customer service and I am amazed that anyone travels Club Europe.

If you know the huge distance between terminal 3 and 5 at Heathrow, you'll know just how much effort the flight attendant put in to returning the handbag. That exceptional level of customer service is almost unheard of these days, so BA get a 100% customer care rating from my wife and I. Snacks were good given it was only a bit over 3 hours flying time. Aircraft was clean, however the only negative was the Business Class seats, in fact the tiny cramped seats was the only thing that BA should really change as it sort of killed an otherwise perfect journey. They were standard Economy Class seats cramped in tight so your knees were pressing into the seat in front.

The aircraft and cabin is looking tired/old, and decidedly mediocre compared to recent business class flights with Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways. Outward excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew. My seat (2K) was shockingly filthy. It had been cleared since the last passenger, but I noticed much ingrained filth e.g. food /drink splatters on the cabin wall, crumbs in seat folds/gaps and stained cover, all sorts of debris on floor in gaps/cracks, and remarkably grimy carpet. Cabin attendant offered me choice of the empty seats, but on inspection these were in a similarly grim state. Seat was OK for comfort, but mediocre IFE choice with very poor quality screen. Meal service was good for food and drink, although dirty environment was off-putting. Lacto Veg’ meal much improved since last tried. Pantry service is underwhelming in places e.g. Mars Bars and KitKats are tragically promoted as retro, but some nice ice cream. Return in 1K, and excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew. I'm ridiculously grateful that this cabin is clean. Tired, so skipped dinner. Decided to watch a short TV programme and found much better picture quality on screen compared to outward, although even less programme choice. I found seat comfort mediocre in bed mode, but got five hours of sleep. The cabin layout is clearly designed to maximise passenger numbers without much thought for their comfort. Awake for breakfast, so when attendants were offering bacon rolls I asked for my wife and my requested Lacto Veg Meals. Staff returned ashen faced, and profusely apologising, with two neatly wrapped and labelled plain white bread rolls. Such bad service, and a lack of joined-up thinking! You couldn’t make it up.

First the positives: check-in at BKK was reasonably efficient the flight departed on time and landed at LHR about 15 minutes early. Unfortunately while World Traveller Plus provides some extra leg room when compared to economy there was nothing else about our flight experience that justified the additional cost of World Traveller Plus. The cabin seating and equipment were tired - the entertainment system was old and barely functional. However by far the worst aspect of the flight was the poor service from the cabin crew who almost without exception appeared uninterested in customer service to the point of rudeness. Their strategy seemed to be to minimise their exposure to customers in order to maximise the time they could spend in the galley at the rear of the aircraft. After the first meal service (an uninspiring Chicken Curry with boiled to death broccoli and carrot not remotely resembling the misleadingly optimistic descriptions found on the BA website about the supposed 'enhanced' dining experience of World Traveller Plus) calls for service went unanswered for lengthy periods of time. It seemed the only effective way to obtain further service was to walk to the rear galley where staff congregated and made it clear they did not appreciate being 'interrupted' barely acknowledging requests while continuing their conversation and grudgingly fulfilling requests to a bare minimum. In stark contrast to the excellent cabin service food and entertainment options we experienced flying in economy on Qantas to Bangkok the previous day this so called 'premium' experience on BA was extremely disappointing. Our advice: don't waste your money on BA World Traveller Plus.

Staff were not particularly helpful gave the impression that everything they did they were doing you a favour. The seating of 2/4/2 in a Business Cabin is unfair trying to pack too many people in.

I got the impression from the very start that BA are penny pinching at every opportunity. Their lounges are basic and the food minimal. Although having a seat on the plane only a few row down from the front some meal selections had run out. The cabin staff hid behind curtains most of the flight therefore service was at a minimum. If you have a window seat you have to straddle the person in the inside seat if you need to get out.
3059,False,,Belgium,,,1.0,,,5,True,BRU-LHR-YYZ: CLUB Europe - Club World; This time again check-in was smooth with friendly ground staff the best croissant in this lounge. Boarding was easy friendly cabin crew was waiting for us to take jackets. Hot towels tasting breakfast landed on time. This short flight 10/10. Security in Heathrow was horror but I prefer the horror of waiting than the horror of terror. First lounge was a breeze. Boarding for the flight to Toronto was with busses driving us to the Dreamliner. Indeed the business seats are smaller. It really felt bad. The flight was not comfortable at all as I left the plane with pain in the back and shoulder. The crew were excellent the food was excellent and the screens are improved. But the space you have is really a shame. As a gold member I fly often business or first but the club world seats in the Dreamliner are really smaller and not comfortable at all. I will avoid this plane in future. I am so happy I will fly back in a 777.
3101,False,,Australia,,,1.0,,,4,True,April 3 2015 Sydney-LHR. Staff were quite attentive and pleasant throughout both sectors. The cabin looked very new was clean and comfortable. IFE was fine although not as good as CX. I was sitting in window seat facing backwards which was fine. The seat while sitting is comfortable enough although quite narrow. There is little storage and it can be awkward getting in and out of the seat especially when you are on the window. The problem was when the seat was in flat-bed mode. It is so narrow that you cannot turn. The seat buckles in the middle. As well the passenger next to me would slam his table and TV monitor shut throughout the flight and because of the design the seat you feel every movement. To get comfortable I had to put the seat in more of a recline mode in order to sleep which defeats the whole purpose of a flat bed. As well a fold down footstool completes the end of the bed and it wasn't stable. BA are charging a premium for this seat and they squeeze 8 across (compared to 4 for CX). They are making a great deal out of this amount of real estate in the air. It is time for them to deliver an update. The only reason I took this fare was because of the great luggage offering (which I needed on this occasion - 96 kg) and the fact that I was flying back in First for no additional cost which I will post about separately. So while I recommend this airline overall it is more because the service and staff did compensate. Next time I fly business it will be CX again. The seat is a real let down.
3117,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,,,2,False,We flew for the very first time on BA on 27/03/15 and returned 06/03/15. Our holiday to St Lucia from Gatwick was booked through Kuoni and we usually fly with Virgin Atlantic. We always upgrade with Virgin to Premium Economy as you have a larger luggage allowance and the Premium Economy Experience with Virgin is very good. Therefore we booked BA World Traveller Plus expecting the same degree of service. What a disappointment! I would not advise wasting your upgrade money. Apart from getting the larger luggage allowance BA World Traveller Plus is almost exactly the same as World Traveller. The Service both ways was appalling! The seats were old and shabby and uncomfortable we were only offered bar service once on a 8/9 Hour flight! We had to drink from plastic beakers the staff seemed preoccupied with Business Class Customers and had no time for our section at all. On the way back my Husband and myself were given seats 2 rows apart at check in without being told. We only noticed when we boarded the aircraft. On this length of flight I was most upset we were apart as everyone sat near me were single travellers and Were asleep throughout the 9 hours. The seat back TVs are very small and my TV didn't work properly and I couldn't even watch anything. The aircraft was badly in need of an interior upgrade. We will never fly with BA again anywhere and will not recommend the experience to anyone.
3129,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,,,2,True,Heathrow to Istanbul flight BA0676 in club class. I should have guessed what I was going to get when I saw this service is operated on a Boeing 767. Business or club class is a total waste of money same seat as in economy. No extra leg room or width no individual inflight entertainment and no seat power it's horrendous you may just as well book euro traveller. Both seats had seen better days the covers of which were in places falling apart. Food was only average too in my opinion. On the plus side of things the plane was for its age (it was the oldest 767 BA has got) in surprisingly good order and the staff were friendly enough and the flight arrived only ten minutes late which is a result.
3207,False,,United States,,,2.0,,,1,False,"I have been a loyal customer for the last 10 years and have progressively seen the service cleanliness and interest in client satisfaction decline. I just came back from a NYC-LHR-Dubai trip and will not fly BA again. Several reasons: my seat in Business Class was noticeably filthy - crumbs on the seat and hair on my pillow. When I told the attendant she just fluffed the pillow and walked away. I was hounded for not filling out the breakfast form in 5 minutes (the plane had not even taken off) and told that ""I would not get breakfast"". I was served raw chicken and when I expressed interest in another dish was told that all the other passengers had eaten and that there were no more dishes on the plane? The dish was taken away but no follow up or apologies - not even an extra bag of nuts to ensure that I was not hungry for the 7.5 hr flight. Perhaps the most disturbing part of traveling with BA is that the staff are unapologetically arrogant disinterested and unapproachable and any response is as if they are doing you a favor. As a customer paying nearly 10000 USD for a round trip ticket I shouldn't be afraid to speak to staff and highlight a dirty seat or food that is not cooked. The seats on two of the legs were broken and my screen did not work on three of the legs. There are plenty of other first class carriers out there that I will now become a customer of."
3252,False,,United States,,,2.0,,,3,True,Washington (IAD) to Heathrow on Christmas Day returning January 5th. I find myself nodding in agreement to many of the reviews written here by other passengers regarding the slippage in standards of BA especially considering what they once were. Having arrived at Dulles in good time to check in there were paper notices on the desk to say that check in would not open 'til 5.00 pm. Okay it was Christmas Day but all other carriers both domestic and international were open (the airport was busy) and I along with other passengers had to sit and wait for 1.5 hrs until staff arrived. The same was true of the lounge which having made it through security was not open 'til 6.30 pm. Again the other airline lounges were open. Having eventually gained access the lounge was great and the bar and dinner service (I was on a sleeper flight) were very good with plentiful drinks and fine food. We boarded on time and my seat was upstairs on the A380. This aircraft is of course huge but the Club World seat is as many have noted much less comfortable than the Boeing 777 or 747. It is narrower and whilst okay for seating very hard and difficult to find the right position for sleeping. BA seem to have missed a great opportunity here to do something really special along the lines of some of the Asian carriers. The crew were very good - friendly and attentive. Breakfast before we landed was very average. The bacon rolls were dried out and are always a challenge to eat. Yoghurt and fruit were the alternatives which I went for. Check in for the return journey was lamentable at Heathrow Terminal 5. Dedicated Club World positions had queues around ten people deep and moved terribly slowly. Not all the positions were open and passengers were visibly irritated. The journey other than the cramped seat issue again was fine with another good crew and food and drinks. I have always recommended BA to friends and would like to keep doing so but feel that especially given the high and rising cost of paying for Club these days BA need to adopt a slightly less 'take' attitude and give a little more especially when it comes to spending Avios which they are very keen for one to accrue but reticent to allow one to use.
3257,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,,,3,False,"I have not travelled with BA for almost 7 years as a result of moving to Asia and using carriers like AF/SQ/Emirates. I flew Premium from LHR to MIA on a 747 and horrified to see that the Premium product has not changed in the last 10 years. BA have quite an ageing fleet now when compared to most European and Asian carriers and it really shows. The entertainment screen was absolutely tiny and the charging point is still that ridiculous adapter for which you have to pay an arm and a leg so pleased I found mine from 7 years back! BA must go and have a look at the AF premium product for a wake up call. The food was okay nothing to rave about and perfectly satisfactory service onboard seems friendly and efficient however the state of the uniforms of some of the staff was shocking not sure if its a case of poor quality material or lack of attention to appearances. I do remember the strap line ""BA the worlds favourite airline"" but sadly they have slipped quite a long way back."
3282,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,,,2,False,"LHR-SFO-LHR. Why do I keep thinking BA will improve? The 747 on this route is falling to bits. Their business class configuration is terrible. Facing a complete stranger having to attempt to climb over other passenger to go to bathroom! Seat narrow and table unusable for dinner unless use knee to hold it up! Food on both legs awful but worse coming from SFO. Also club kitchen pathetic. IFE systems the worst of any airline. BA please travel on Emirates just once and see how it should be done. Staff on way out on upper deck very nice and attentive however on return to LHR on upper deck staff were verging on ""can't be bothered""! Served dinner during severe turbulence which you could not eat so they could get dinner finished and sit down for rest of flight. Had to go to galley to get drink as ignored call button. Then empties sat on table for two hours before I dumped them in galley. Breakfast consisted of hard fruit and greasy bacon tiny roll. Both of which left uneaten. I keep booking through blind loyalty but after Bahrain and San Fran in December decided no more. They have just got too bad."
3309,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,,,1,False,TPA - LGW on Dec 10th in PE. BA have total monopoly on the London/Tampa rout and don't they know it. I fly this about every six weeks or so normally in Club World but sometimes in Premium just due to the huge price variance. The quality of the planes on this route but more importantly the service and staff attitude are way below the standard you would expect and this trip was no exception. Old plane miserable arrogant staff and poor service. I pray every time I fly that another carrier will take up a slot at Tampa as it's a growing airport and when they do BA will definitely lose my business and I suspect many others.
3314,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,,,1,False,British Airways are not interested in providing normal business class comforts and cuisine or even lounges on some routes. The Cancun route and the Nassau routes I have flown recently show this clearly as they are presumably are not bothered with little or no competition at all. This saddens me that they have made a clear decision that on holiday type routes they will provide the absolute minimum on everything. One example that shows how pathetic it has become with cutbacks out of many problems I encountered on these routes is that the food was so awful on the Cancun flight recently that we merely asked for cheese and biscuits in business class to be told that we could only have one packet of two biscuits each as BA only allocated one packet per person. The staff all agree that this was pathetic! No lounges at both these airports either and queuing of business class and economy all together no attempt to really show you paid extra for your ticket.
3325,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,,,3,True,LHR-HEL Club Europe / HEL-LHR Economy. Club has improved a lot. Great service from staff. Greeting you by your name. However the food was just cold cuts and salad - dessert thin slices of fruit. The new seats are not very comfortable but I sat in the first row so had ample leg room. Not sure if worth a full fare but as a part miles ticket it was enjoyable. The return in economy was fine. Again the new seats are not comfortable - much prefer the old ones although the cabin does look very nice. In economy you were served a sandwich and drinks including beer. I fly the same route regularly in Finnair and BA is a superior service. The flight attendants did a good job. Not overly friendly but quite attentive. The lounge at LHR terminal 3 is ok but breakfast was pretty bad. Egg muffins with no taste at all - do recommend Club Europe but only when not paying top fare.
3346,False,,Canada,,,1.0,,,2,False,Check-in in Toronto was OK no fast track was apparent although it was purportedly offered. Lounge in YYZ was nice pre-flight dinner was just about OK with modest quality wines offered. Chose an Aisle seat YYZ-LHR bad idea. Seats are incredibly narrow not quite wide enough for my shoulders. Tried to sleep but not possible with in-flight staff constantly leaning across me lowering the partition and speaking to the Window Seat passenger who appeared to be a BA staff member who was determined to drink all night. Didn't eat dinner but breakfast was adequate. Decided on a window seat for the return LHR-YYZ. Bad idea again! Very claustrophobic. During the entire flight I managed to get one small glass of champagne it was very good. Thereafter no matter how many times I pressed my call button no one came thus nothing more to drink other than a glass of red wine with my dinner. No offers of cognac or liqueurs. Dinner ingredients were clearly good and well chosen but everything was so overcooked it was inedible. When I say over-cooked I mean grey vegetables that disintegrated on your fork and meat that was so dry and stringy that it was actually really unpleasant. Hadn't flown BA for a number of years and being a Brit thought it would be a pleasant change from Air Canada on this route. It was a change but not a pleasant one. It's back to AC for me. Their business class is way better than this experience. Perhaps I was just unfortunate. On the plus side the aircraft was immaculately clean clearly quite new and the inbound flight was spot on time.
3387,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,,,4,True,Flew LGW-ACE-LHR. Arrived at Gatwick and was greeted at the check in counter by a friendly member of BA ground staff our bags were taken and we proceeded toward fast track security this was effortless and after a few minutes we were in the BA galleries lounge. I find that the BA lounge at Gatwick offers a very poor service early in the morning all you are likely to get food wise is warm toast pastries and condiments! The flight boarded on time and priority was given to those flying in the premium cabin I proceeded onto the plane and was greated by the purser who showed me to my seat and took my coat. After take off the inflight service consisted of a hot English breakfast which was very nice followed by tea/coffee - this is an early flight so no other drink service was offered however the purser did ask each passenger individually if they would like anything from the bar. Very friendly and attentive crew who addressed each passenger by their name which was a nice touch. The return flight to Heathrow was also very good the lounge at Alicante is typical of those in Spain rows of uncomfortable seating with inedible food offerings! Again another uneventful boarding process the purser on this flight was very attentive and spoke to everyone individually the meal tasted delicious chicken curry and rice. All in all BA offer a good Club Europe service they are trying to cut back and this often shows they need to consider upgrading their product or risk losing out to the likes of Easyjet or Ryanair.
3401,False,,Australia,,,1.0,,,1,False,BA 0027 ex London HR to Hong Kong which departed 30/9/14. Hong Kong to London Sector on 17/9/14. Inedible food lukewarm drinks cabin staff unsmiling and standard of personal grooming very low toilets were horrible- no loo paper or hand towels half way through 13 hour flight. It was a relief to get onto Cathay Pacific flight for next stage of my journey. How can two airlines be so different? British Airways is a disgrace.
3425,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,,,1,False,BA213 Heathrow to Boston 29/09/14 B747. There was nothing at all to commend this flight. I have had better comfort and service on low cost carriers. The seats must be the narrowest in class for any major airline. The business lounge at Heathrow is not well signed and awkwardly placed at the top of escalators. At 0830 in the morning the tables were overflowing with used crockery and waste food. When staff did appear they did a very cursory clearing job. Never once in two hours did I see any of the sticky tables being wiped down. On boarding I was neither shown to my seat nor addressed by name as I have been on other airlines. When I asked for assistance in putting my hand luggage in the overhead locker - I was told in no uncertain terms staff were not allowed to help. Again I have always had help on business flights on other airlines. In the air the level of discomfort rose as those in the inside seats were forced to jump over my out stretched legs and cabin staff leant over me to serve the inside seats. The level of service could not remotely be considered acceptable for the price paid. Add in poor food and IFE and decision to avoid BA flights in future was made for me.
3431,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,,,1,False,"BA176 JFK to Heathrow 13 October 2014. The outward flight had been so awful so the return surely could not be any worse. How wrong I was. Arrived at business check-in at JFK terminal 7. No staff at desk. Boarding pass printed at machine but had to wait nearly twenty minutes to check luggage. Agent was rude and unhelpful. Onto the BA lounge. Sagging shabby seats and no food except crisps. On asking the receptionist where the food was I was told passengers normally use the much advertised ""pre-boarding supper"" facility. Asked when this opened and was told it was not operating. Eventually some badly cut sandwiches and lumps of cheese with crackers appeared. No hot food was available. Two hours before departure the flight was posted as four minutes late. No further information was posted. When I asked for an update thirty minutes before scheduled take-off I was told there would be an announcement shortly. Eventually a barely audible announcement came that the plane was now boarding. The departures board had not been updated so premium passengers were forced to shuffle along with those in the main cabin. Onboard after presenting my boarding pass I was given a grunted down there with no indication as to which side of the plane I was seated. On reflection late boarding may have been a blessing. I lost count of the times I was knocked by oversized and heavy hand luggage. Eventually the safety demonstration was played on the IFE system. The sound was inaudible. Surely a safety hazard. Similarly all announcements from the cockpit went unheard. We took off one hour and fifteen minutes late with no explanation given for the delay. The wine selection was very limited on the flight as was the menu two choices of main course and only one dessert - I asked if I could have the advertised ice cream snack for desert to be told there was none on board. Food was barely edible. Service was poor. The cabin crew seemed intent on throwing trays round as fast as possible. My salad was served with desert (which I did not want) on the tray. The main course was overcooked beef near raw vegetables. I was made to feel a nuisance when I asked for a second glass of wine. The narrow seat converted to a narrow and not very comfortable bed. Other carriers provide mattresses and duvets. BA seem to think a tacky blanket will do. The whole service has been downgraded to the standards I would expect in economy class. The nicieties that used to mark business flights have been lost in the pursuit of profit. Given that BA charge far more that their competitors for this route I was thoroughly disappointed. I will not use any BA flight again if there is an alternative available."
3433,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,,,2,True,"Aberdeen-Heathrow-Miami and return World Traveller Plus (premium economy). Received a text from BA at 0600 that our 09:30 ABZ-LHR flight had been cancelled which would impact upon the US flight. Phoned the helpline as suggested. Utterly useless options provided by their staff which was weighted towards a ticket refund - no use for a family holiday. Made unsuitable suggestions including can you get to Aberdeen for the 7:30 flight (it was 7am and had now spent 1hr on phone to them). Gave up and just went to the airport. Fortunately BA staff there were excellent and got me on next flight to Heathrow despite breaching their own min of 1 hour requirement for connections. Flight to London was good with good service leather seats. Cabin crew facilitated us getting off plane first and BA staff member met us to get us to next gate ASAP for Miami flight. Service centre useless but face to face staff great. LHR-MIA flight. Aircraft a 747 was old and tatty and WT+ seats were rubbish in comparison to Virgin product that I have experienced. Not that comfortable. Seat back TV is same as economy namely 4"" across tiny but selection was ok and seats are fabric and didn't seem that much better than economy. Food (beef) was outstanding for aircraft food. Staff were pretty good. Aircraft on time. Return journey much the same but staff were better. Conclusion is that face to face staff great food great. But needs a modern fleet - our 747 was really aged and their world traveller plus product needs work with hindsight probably would have just travelled economy as leg room wasn't that much more. If you take a iPad to watch movies and are not tall economy would do the job. Their helpline needs to be addressed. Clue being in the title - HELPline. Would fly BA again but would think about their WT+ option carefully."
3445,False,,Australia,,,1.0,,,1,False,Don't even think about flying on this airline. Booked paid for and confirmed last February for a premium economy flight Singapore to Sydney for last Saturday. When I checked in at Changi the check-in staff member told me the incoming flight from London was overbooked and I was downgraded to economy (against my wishes obviously). I would never have booked BA but for the premium economy offering so huge disappointment. GB75 compensation is simply not good enough. Add to that the economy meal was inedible (what did they do to the seafood curry). Never again.
3466,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,,,2,False,LHR to YVR. September 29 2014. I've been a loyal BA passenger for years but after three recent flights that's not going to be the case any more. How BA have the audacity to screen 'BA A Very British Airline' on their IFE is beyond me! While the film chronicles the supposed high standards and rigorous staff selection and training the reality is altogether different. The food on BA85 LHR to YVR was atrocious - dried chicken sitting in a dubious brown 'sauce'. The service was unsmiling unhelpful and inattentive. BA used to have a good IFE selection. Not anymore! Very unimaginative selection of films TV and audio programs. I've recently travelled on Qantas and Air Canada on long haul and both carriers far superior to BA. Air Canada has significantly improved it's standards.
3495,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,,,1,False,Flew Heathrow - Madrid return. Have always been loyal to BA but no longer. T5 Lounge overcrowded poor range of food rubbish and uncleared crockery and glasses everywhere - not particularly pleasant. Bags not tagged priority. Fast Track not fast. Service on board to Madrid was exceptionally good and old style BA. Return bags not tagged priority no priority boarding old aircraft rude staff cramped seating poor and cost cutting catering with no attempt at service beyond handing out. Very disappointing experience and unacceptable. Could not select seats on-line for return flight as computer had allocated them. Eventually seats changed when called call centre - told couldn't be done for half an hour and strangely as the conversation moved forward they could do it. Waste of time and energy. Practically everything suggested as part of the Club Europe package didn't happen. Club Europe used to be so distinctive and worth and I always felt it was worth the premium price. To be honest I have cheaper alternatives from closer airports which I will now be using for my regular flights to and from Spain.
3498,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,,,3,False,I have flown LHR-BKK many times with EVA Emirates Oman and Qatar. Unfortunately this time I chose my National carrier. Disappointed is not the word. To start with the seating arrangement is absurd. All the others manage 1-2-1 or 2-2-2. BA manages 6 abreast in a horrible tight arrangement whereby you face your neighbour. When the hot towels were given out they were like warm rags in comparison to the other airlines. Food - ok there was a selection on the menu. However at service time I was merely passed a tray over my neighbour. On every Qatar flight you are not only addressed by your name but the table is made for you as if being in a 5* restaurant. None of this with BA. Once the appetiser and first course are consumed you hand the bowls back to the attendent who then passes your main course to you in a bowl. Shabby is not the word. After a reasonable sleep in a very narrow bed it was time for landing. With no sign of a priority immigration pass being given I asked the steward for one. He replied they did not have any for this flight but assured me there would be ground staff at the gate to supply this basic amenity. Stupidly I believed him. Upon departure at BKK no ground staff or passes. I return to the UK next week and for the first time ever I am dreading the experience. Never ever will I fly my national carrier again. Disgraceful. It's any Middle East airline again for me. Qatar being my preferred choice.

3509,False,,Australia,,,1.0,,,1,False,Flew SYD-SIN and had a reasonably comfortable trip. Problem is I didn't see much of the staff in premium economy and they were not very smiley either harassed looking. Service definitely down none of the goodies you used to get like snacks and plenty of water. Everyone rather terse I thought and not helpful. Not my favourite to fly. The aisle and seat space are for pixies not real people.
3510,False,,Ireland,,,2.0,,,1,False,First and last time flying with BA upgraded the 4 of us to Premium Economy at £199 each for 4 of us a complete waste of money. Have done this with Virgin on occasions for long haul flights and its so worth the money and not as expensive. Food terrible crew and staff not friendly no drinks offered only when handing out food. None of us could eat the food it was so bad. On a 9 hour flight we were hungry. Don't waste your money upgrading I wish I had read reviews before I left.
3532,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,,,1,False,"Travelled as a family of four to the Maldives. Despite numerous requests many weeks in advance we didn't get seats together on the outbound journey. The plane was old and the entertainment system antiquated. This seems to be an issue on BA routes with little competition it was a similar story when we flew club to Mauritius. On that trip the entertainment system failed all together. On the return journey from Male I watched what I thought to be a three part crime drama called ""the tunnel"". Only after watching the third part did I discover that there was a fourth or more! Why? Why would you not have all the story? This experience aside many airlines have better entertainment systems in economy than the BA service in business on this route. When you are paying this kind of money to take two children business class you want good entertainment to keep them occupied. They don't need the space! Would also have been nice to sit together! Food was grim my ten year old son who normally devours everything ate nothing on both legs of the trip. A ten hour flight with travel at either end is a long time without food. There seemed to be a hurry to serve the food throw a bottle of water at you and then shut down service until an hour before arrival. On the outbound journey I pressed the service button after 15 minutes it self cancelled. Pressed again 15 minutes later it self cancelled. I returned my glass to the galley myself the staff were so busy chatting amongst themselves they didn't notice me. Presumably this is why they didn't see the service request either. On the return trip service was a little chaotic and well below standards you should expect. Food was equivalently poor. This is the second BA business class trip I've taken to the Maldives and each time I have been disappointed given the cost. I've also travelled economy on Emirates to Male which was actually better and business on Emirates which was fantastic. I know BA have monopoly on the direct route from Gatwick to Male but I will be going via Dubai on Emirates in future."
3540,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,,,1,False,"I have flown twice with BA now in business class (to and from Delhi) and I have to say it has been absolutely poor! Me and a few colleagues flew out to New Delhi for a business trip. BA were the pioneers of aircraft's after all they did create The Concorde. Key word in that is ""were"" they've basically turned into a no frills airline. Allow me to explain: The blue worn carpets padded fabric seats with stains worn out grey plastic panels with little grains of grit and dirt get into and a TFT which had the same image quality as VHS tape! The decor looks like it was directly taken out of the 1980 film Airplane! You still get the odd knock on the legs when economy passengers are boarding then plane with hand luggage as there is no private space! Staff were fine but flying business class a customer should get a wow factor - and there was none. The plastic translucent slider that divides the seats had been battered from being shifted up and down when the crew serve the food and drinks. The toilets are exactly the same as economy except in Business class they stick a plastic flower in a glass. The food was OK but again nothing special. Normally its the little things that make the differences but with BA they need a total make over. For a flight that happens everyday from London to Delhi BA should be doing more. The decor of the plane matched the experience I got with BA dull. I won't be flying long haul with them again. My advice - avoid BA and before you book your flights have a look online at what other airlines can offer you."
3660,False,,Canada,,,1.0,,,1,False,We travelled to and from Europe in business class for a two week Mediterranean cruise. We upgraded to business for the added benefit of sleep. My first impression is that the fleet is tired and not very well kept. The seats were uncomfortable the cabin was dirty and staff were surly. The food as expected on any airplane was adequate though nothing to brag about (take advantage of the scones and clotted cream - their only saving grace). Upon our return we awaited in London Heathrow Terminal 5 for them to put the gate on our flight. It finally appeared 20 minutes before the flight where it showed we were in satellite C - it took us over 15 minutes to get there to have the gate agent tell us we should have been there earlier. She did upgrade us so we thought at least that was a perk. Well I am here to tell all - don't pay the money. There is little to no difference in first class. The seats are just as uncomfortable the food was the same and I still felt like a second class citizen. This time I think it was because were an upgrade so we were always served last and with little selection/choice. To tell you the truth if I had paid for this upgrade I would have been upset as I don't believe this is up to par. We also did a connector flight from Venice to London on the Saturday. The airport was a disaster (3 cruise ships all flying out the same time) no organization from the agents and very little help. When we got on the other side of the check in the multi-million dollar duty free area was amazing but really they should have taken some of the money to deal with the check in area. Upon moving through security we were kept in the dungeon area of the airport to wait with tepid air conditioning while our flight was delayed with no explanation. When we were finally boarded we were told by the captain that the delay was due to thunderstorms and we were still going to have to wait. The last part is not fully BA's fault (they don't design the airports or determine airspace closure) however their agents did nothing to make it better either (by having people out to direct traffic or give us updates). All in all I don't believe I will ever fly BA again - this is unfortunate because they used to set the standard - now they are barely sweeping up the floor (wish they had - at least it may have been cleaner).
3667,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,,,1,False,I flew LHR-YVR outwards 20th May 2014 on 747. The cabin newly fitted and no problems on return leg 10th June 2014 we were greeted with old style fittings. The whole cabin was very shabby and the seats were damaged and the TV set was unwatchable as the picture was so dark. Even the staff apologised for the state of the cabin and seats so if it is so bad why do BA sell these seats. I would be unlikely to book 1st class again with BA unless they would guarantee that the plane would have the updated seats and cabin.
3749,False,,Australia,,,1.0,,,1,False,I flew Singapore to Sydney with them recently and it was the most horrible flying experience. At the boarding gate the staff were just so disorganised in getting the passengers on board that we had to wait for almost an hour before we got on. The plane was an old and tired 747-400 which had the dirtiest cabin I have seen. There was a stale smell lingering in the premium economy cabin. The seats were old worn out and lumpy despite being in premium economy. The inflight entertainment was a joke. The video quality was mediocre and the noise cancelling headphones were not working for most of the flight. The food was some strange fried rice which was bland. The crew were unfriendly they didn't serve drinks once throughout the flight. The worst part were the toilets smelly with a toilet bowl and sink choked with toilet paper. Overall I will never fly British Airways again unless I don't have any choice.
