Review
Unfortunately we were stranded in the plane and waited a very long time to disembark the plane due to lack of staff or slot shortage (it’s a common problem with BA at Heathrow).
Cabin staff don't bother implementing their own rules.
Anyone with a connecting flight couldn't rebook on the application because the app wouldn't disassociate our first flight with the connecting one in London and the staff saw this but still refused to help us.
The worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customers.
"The ground staff’s attitude was that they are merely third party agents,"
I guess staff are badly paid from their terrible attitude and service.
The staff are very rude and not trained properly.
2) Staff demanded that we check in our carry on luggage even though we met our carry on allowance.
3) Staff were quite unpleasant.
A single BA staff member turned up to board a full flight shortly before the flight was due to depart.
Once on board the captain blamed Frankfurt ground staff for delaying takeoff when clearly late boarding had resulted in a missed departure slot.
Why don't you hire enough personnel to fulfil your staff demand.
"Staff uncommunicative,"
The staff at the gate was very cordial and helpful once we arrived there.
Most customers she serves have a complaint Staff don't care as poor service and unhappy customers is a routine occurrence.
The ground staff were not helpful.
The British Airways staff said that we could go book any hotel up to 200 pounds and we would be reimbursed.
Denied wheelchair assistance at LHR for my wife and the staff forced us to change terminals by foot.
"Rude staff on BA297 from LHR to ORD on April 05,"
the BA staff onboard yelled at my wife and asked her to be go back to seat.
Horrible flight with disappointing staff.
"Held up at transit security by a clown of a member of staff,"
Staff were rude demanding selected passengers put their hand luggage in the hold.
"Staff need customer training,"
Then when that was done there was a further delay as there were no ground staff to operate the skybridge.
I took the elderly gentleman with me to IBERIA where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with IBERIA.
The staff are friendly.
"today is day 6 and BA staff over the phone say ""call after 72 hours""."
had to extract information from staff that they arrived to Vancouver on Jan 2nd.
Attitude with British Airways staff has been absolutely horrendous.
"met with nothing but rude staff,"
"Very rude and unhelpful staff and I will chose another carrier in the future,"
The staff were no help and frankly rude.
In preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in Frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in Business Class passengers).
"We asked BA staff for refund,"
"Our 2 internal flights between London and Edinburgh were great due to the friendly staff and there were no complications,"
"the staff seemed very overwhelmed,"
"Overall it took us about 2 hours to get me checked in after speaking to about 6 different staff members,"
The staff were friendly enough but they were rarely seen between meals.
the staff will say there is nothing they can do.
so a large group of passengers had to roam round Dubai airport looking for BA staff.
only one member of staff is processing people whilst other BA staff stood around on their phones or having a chat.
One member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in.
There are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally.
then gate staff said the aircraft has not been given permission to land at Aberdeen due to poor weather.
"BA staff were rude and dismissive of customer complaints at length of time bags were taking to arrive,"
Check in staff friendly but too few of them.
drugs and bad attitude and when you complained you were fobbed off as they knew there was no BA staff to sound off too.
where two BA staff were contradicting each other.
No check in staff for Economy.
they had to protect staff'.
At check-in desk at T5 Heathrow was told by BA staff that Sweden only allowing Swedish nationals into country.
I offered the phone to BA staff to clear up any confusion.
"While in-flight staff at BA are still terrific,"
The staff was unfriendly and inconsiderate to me.
Extremely rude staff and service.
We had to wait for 40 minutes before any check in staff turned up.
the staff were surly and rude.
Service bad from staff.
For the price of the airline ticket the whole experience was way below expected service and time of staff.
Very rude check in staff when told we had to print out boarding passes and also for our suitcases.
The staff in purple at the airport who are supposed to help passengers find connecting flights didn’t know what to do.
My wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st August because our two pieces of luggage were left in Heathrow Airport by BA staff when we took the transit flight from the UK to Copenhagen.
we kept phoning and emailing Menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so.
Menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport.
We believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up.
we couldn't find our luggage and the staff didn't explain why and just told us to leave.
The staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us.
We are literally sick of phoning Menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere.
Now that Menzies staff asked us to pressure BA to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage.
They clearly train their staff in the multitude of ways to frustrate their customers.
It’s easier to use the train than fly with BA the staff don’t even get embarrassed anymore and stand smiling offering apologies to the tired and weary customers.
"All the flights were cancelled without explanation - presumably because the striking staff didn't turn up,"
BA staff watched while security went through partner's bag for around 30 mins.
a British Airways staff was ready with another ticket from Delhi to Mumbai without me even asking.
Unlike all the other airlines that I have travelled with there were no staff member greeting the connecting customers to point them in the right direction or re-assure them.
"Rude staff,"
I spilled my drink and the attitude of the staff was brutal.
but I was made to feel like I had deliberately done some shameful act in public and staff would not want to have anything to do with me.
The staff did not even have the courtesy to ask me if I needed another drink once I cleaned myself up.
"The staff wrote Bangalore via Heathrow,"
The staff at check-in could not have been less helpful.
In the plane there is no place for my bag and the staff said sorry sir we don’t have space and you can put that underneath your seat.
"The staff offered little apology,"
Staff on the flight were clumsy and rude - one attendant dropped a water bottle on my shoulder and offered the merest apology.
Ground staff forced me to check-in my suitcase during boarding process due to lack of space in the plane and I got my suitcase damaged with 2 big cuts on the back.
there were large numbers or Argentinian passengers on the plane yet I saw no staff that spoke Spanish.
30 mins after I realised I went back to the airport but no British Airways staff was willing to help.
Dialed for BA baggage enquiry and staff picked up the phone and hung up on purpose and never answered again.
"When I called the staff over she had no idea what a vegan was,"
"so we asked for a coffee with Soya Milk - the staff to whom I had had to explain what a vegan was said ""oh I don't think we have that,"
unhelpful staff.
Delays seem so regular that staff have a casual attitude to delays.
The check in staff were very forceful and abrupt.
no announcement and the ground staff were in a world of their own.
"I show the staff my mobile boarding pass,"
Boarding was with the same unhelpful and unprofessional staff with the very arrogant manner.
I was told by BA check in staff in Venice that it is against their baggage policy to allow luggage to be fastened together.
The staff were clear that it is BA policy that bags cannot be fastened together.
the customer service staff have failed to provide evidence of the baggage policy alleged by their check in staff in Venice.
BA has also refused to confirm whether these two check in staff are in fact BA employees or employed by a third party.
When i mentioned to the onboard staff I was hungry I was informed there are no snacks available and a meal would be served shortly before landing.
Staff overall were uninterested and unhelpful.
We were not offered Tea or Coffee at any point and found the staff inattentive.
"Staff were ok,"
however the staff in the counter keep question if my mom can speak English.
Staff could not distinguish the Taiwan passport from the China passport and keep said that we need Visa to go to Spain.
The worst staff I had  met.
"On my return flight from Oakland to Gatwick when I went to the check in luggage I was told by the staff at the desk that TSA will break my lock to check through my luggage,"
When I mentioned this to the staff who gave me this food she said that’s what you asked for but I said sorry I didn’t as on the food label clearly says 18A and my seat no is 18K so how is this my food.
Their lounge at DUS is closed but their check-in staff doesn't know that (she sent me up there).
I was told on the Saturday that my hand luggage was fine (the right size) by BA staff at Geneva airport - it was physically inspected.
"Staff at the airport were insanely rude (to be honest,"
Staff were very friendly and helpful however.
There stewards and stewardesses are rude and unprofessional compared with the professionalism of other airline staff.
but the BA ground staff handling was awful - to the point of zero in reality.
but the cabin staff service (that has always been their stronger point) was terrible.
About 30min after the plane took off the food trolley was wheeled up to the club class curtain and staff man had the task of selling all the leftovers from the outbound flight.
The main difference with BA now is the rudeness and sheer unprofessionalism of staff I encountered.
"Both times the ground staff were inconsitant,"
It has the worst service and incredibly rude staff.
this member of BA staff shouts at us for everyone to hear and asks us to go to the back of the line.
No greeting or assistance on boarding from cabin staff.
"Cabin staff rude and unhelpful,"
information filtered through Italian speaking passengers who sought help with staff from Iberia airlines.
BA staff was gone after 6pm and we were shuttled to hotel and told a rep would give us further information at hotel.
"The staff could not have cared less and spent the time chatting about how low BA had sunk,"
how staff morale was terrible and how they could escape!
boarding in Stuttgart by agency staff was chaotic - unsure who was entitled to what.
the airline has gone down and staff really don't care - especially in heathrow baggage office.
"When I got the BA self service machine with 55 minutes remaining in the original flight timing (and almost 2+ hours before the actual flight time) I had issues printing my boarding pass and was told by the helper to go to Zone E to get a Boarding pass printed by the counter staff,"
"The staff are surly and abrupt,"
"The staff tried in vain to change the ticket but were told by faceless managers,"
Upon takeoff the aircon above decided it was going to start leaking water above - when the guy sat in seat enquired the staff smiled said she would see what she can do then went to the galley behind me and I heard her say to a co-worker that's the last of her problems.
"I informed the cabin staff of this - but due to the flight being overbooked,"
When I complained about this to the flight staff on the second occasion (keep in mind this was at the end of the flight when I had been sitting on an uncomfortable metal bar for 10 hours) - the steward informed me that 'I was travelling to a poor country and I should be grateful for the food I was getting'.
I do not book flights with BA to get lectured by your flight staff.
I checked a bag so just had a small carry on but the staff insisted it have this silly thing attached that I immediately ripped off.
"The BA staff at the airport weren't helpful at all,"
Poor communications from LHR British Airways staff.
British Airways were completely under staffed and disorganised.
Staff are old and 'entitled'.
"I was looking forward to a sandwich or at least a croissant to take the hunger off and was completely shocked when the cabin staff came round with a tray and offered us either a mini size kit kat,"
"The cabin staff told me it was the new policy,"
"the ground staff proceed to suggest that its my fault because I booked two separate tickets,"
Staff have attitude across the board.
Cabin staff stomp up and down the aisle attending to premium economy - bumped into numerous times.
"The cabin staff would rather have other passengers disturbed by aggravated,"
Staff seemed tired and overworked at counters.
The charge to reserve your seat is extortionate The check in staff at Gatwick were miserable to the point of rudeness.
They ground staff explained they had cancelled my ticket as they thought I would not make it.
On this particular flight staff seemed unfriendly and unapproachable and there seemed to be a general contempt for economy travellers.
When I asked the BA staff and managers to arrange access they only gave me an insulting £5 worth of voucher.
surly staff that act like BA was still a 1970's state enterprise.
Doesn't matter how much it weighs as long as bags are of a certain size but even this is not enforced or monitored by the airport staff.
"Very grumpy and abrupt staff and the meal,"
"The cabin staff seemed hell bent on racing through ""meal"" service to maximise time available to chat in the galley."
Staff were very friendly but they must be embarrassed by the lowering of standards on British Airways.
"Whilst some of the cabin staff are lovely,"
British Airways staff were no where to be found!
two hours to clear customs because they were short staffed.
Well dealt with by cabin staff.
Cabin staff great but product is poor.
"Ground staff were the now usual bunch of jobs worths,"
Cabin staff were rude and uncaring.
the cabin staff were surly and uninterested.
Cabin staff were very good.
"Whilst I would agree that the staff on AA see passengers as a necessary evil (particularly as we were the lowest of the low in standard economy),"
Service was variable - the VOD in my seat did not work (all I could get was the map) and one of the staff reset it (quite grudgingly I felt) 3 times without success.
Thankfully a more senior staff member was able to find the only other unoccupied seat about 3 hours after takeoff.
Staff on board appeared far from athletic.
Check-in staff rude and arrogant and didn't explain the delay.
Other people were turned back rather rudely by BA staff.
Staff are extremely unhelpful and will never use BA ever again.
So why no extra staff to cope with this?
desk staffed by only one person.
"When we touched down in Bombay the flight attendants said that BA ground staff would help us with missed flights,"
On this advice we sought out uniformed BA ground staff in the luggage hall and asked for advice on what to do.
Armed with this advice from BA staff we went ahead and purchased new tickets.
I can only conclude that the BA staff member we spoke with in Bombay was either fobbing us off or was improperly instructed in what to say to customers.
Either way British Airways should be held responsible for the advice their staff give.
Are British Airways training their staff to be as rude and obnoxious as possible?
Passengers were arguing with one another (3 separate fights were witnessed) and staff were being very aggressive shoving bags and coats in every nook and cranny and telling people to move.
I was told by a member of staff that my name was not on the system.
The flight attendant told me not to worry and there will be lots of BA ground staff to help us all when we arrive at Johannesburg.
Once landed there were no British Airways staff present - except for one lady in a High Vis jacket who explained to people that needed to get the connecting flight to Johannesburg to leave their luggage as it would be put on the plane and to Run to the next gate for the flight.
No staff were helpful even though I was crying and feeling completely bewildered.
"The staff were loud and abrupt,"
Oh and the flight was delayed and the boarding staff were slow and inefficient.
the problems came when we had to deal with the Orlando check in staff and customer complaints in uk.
"This turned into 2 hours of sheer hell with the staff (including airport manager) while my baby screamed the place down hungry,"
The staff were rude and arrogant and refused to admit they had messed up and refused to change our seats back as they had seated someone else there who had no baby.
plus the staff were abrupt and snappy.
"It did not help that the British Airways staff blatantly allowed people to cut in line,"
"The counter staff,"
but as usual when you present at the bag-drop the staff member will say whatever is necessary to get you away and through security with minimum fuss and delay.
but staff were helpful.
"poor organisation with bad customer service from British Airways staff who didn't care that I would have a 5 hour delay,"
No staff seemed to care about the delay my partner and I were experiencing after a 7 hour flight.
Our plane was really old and most staff were almost the same.
"Upon checking in to return was met with rude staff who commented ""don't even touch that it's hassle just refer her to ticketing"" where I spent the next two hours waiting for them to check me in."
However this wasn't all - check in staff went on to tell me that my 32 kilo case could not be boarded as it was too heavy under health and safety regulations.
Would never fly British Airways again due to the complete and utter incompetence of the ground staff at Miami.
rude and impatient staff at the baggage drop and only one person to help at the check in machines.
Staff pretended to be interested and made glib promises about refund and upgrades for the way home which turned out to be a pack of lies.
