On this advice we sought out uniformed BA ground staff in the luggage hall and asked for advice on what to do.,Staff Attitude
Armed with this advice from BA staff we went ahead and purchased new tickets.,Staff Attitude
I can only conclude that the BA staff member we spoke with in Bombay was either fobbing us off or was improperly instructed in what to say to customers.,Staff Attitude
Either way British Airways should be held responsible for the advice their staff give.,Others
Are British Airways training their staff to be as rude and obnoxious as possible?,Others
Passengers were arguing with one another (3 separate fights were witnessed) and staff were being very aggressive shoving bags and coats in every nook and cranny and telling people to move.,Others
The staff at Paris airport refused to check-in my piece of luggage on the continuing Avianca flight because I had not booked that ticket with BA.,Staff Attitude
"When I pointed out to the BA staff the impact this would have they said it was my fault for booking 2 separate tickets,",Staff Attitude
"and it appeared that some staff and/or standby passengers were given priority,",Others
"BA refused to state whether staff or standby passengers had been prioritised,",Staff Attitude
"and this applies to individuals but not to categories such as staff or standby,",Others
I was told by a member of staff that my name was not on the system.,Others
The flight attendant told me not to worry and there will be lots of BA ground staff to help us all when we arrive at Johannesburg.,Staff Attitude
Once landed there were no British Airways staff present - except for one lady in a High Vis jacket who explained to people that needed to get the connecting flight to Johannesburg to leave their luggage as it would be put on the plane and to Run to the next gate for the flight.,Staff Attitude
No staff were helpful even though I was crying and feeling completely bewildered.,Others

"The staff were loud and abrupt,",Others
"She radioed another member of staff to ask if we were to be allowed to come on the flight in an extremely moody manner,",Others
Eventually we were allowed and with one last scowl from the staff left the desk.,Others
We had a long wait at a deserted Genoa airport and no British Airways or other staff were on hand to assist or offer drink or food.,Others
The staff was very friendly.,Others
Looking after our area was a charming staff who really made us feel welcome and did his very best to find some people seconds if they were left hungry after the meal.,Staff Attitude
Oh and the flight was delayed and the boarding staff were slow and inefficient.,Others
the problems came when we had to deal with the Orlando check in staff and customer complaints in uk.,Others
"This turned into 2 hours of sheer hell with the staff (including airport manager) while my baby screamed the place down hungry,",Others
The staff were rude and arrogant and refused to admit they had messed up and refused to change our seats back as they had seated someone else there who had no baby.,Others
plus the staff were abrupt and snappy.,Others
"It did not help that the British Airways staff blatantly allowed people to cut in line,",Others
"The counter staff,",Others
"ground staff said they had no authority - lots of phone calls nothing achieved,",Others
but as usual when you present at the bag-drop the staff member will say whatever is necessary to get you away and through security with minimum fuss and delay.,Others
"poor organisation with bad customer service from British Airways staff who didn't care that I would have a 5 hour delay,",Lack of Staff
No staff seemed to care about the delay my partner and I were experiencing after a 7 hour flight.,Others
the seats and decor was tired and the staff rude.,Others
The staff were better than the previous flight.,Others
Our plane was really old and most staff were almost the same.,Others
"Upon checking in to return was met with rude staff who commented ""don't even touch that it's hassle just refer her to ticketing"" where I spent the next two hours waiting for them to check me in.",Others
However this wasn't all - check in staff went on to tell me that my 32 kilo case could not be boarded as it was too heavy under health and safety regulations.,Others
Would never fly British Airways again due to the complete and utter incompetence of the ground staff at Miami.,Others
Flight was delayed by more than 2 hours but ground staff were unfriendly and unwilling to help arrange transport options even though plane touched down after midnight with no public transport options available.,Others
rude and impatient staff at the baggage drop and only one person to help at the check in machines.,Others
"Inability of BA ground staff to communicate with immigration (a walk of about 6 feet or a phone call),",Staff Attitude
Staff pretended to be interested and made glib promises about refund and upgrades for the way home which turned out to be a pack of lies.,Others
"The staff were friendly and food was good,",Others
but then we were told our baggage would be with us within two days by one of British Airways staff.,Staff Attitude
"The staff have been unhelpful and unwilling to aid us in finding our luggage,",Staff Attitude
We informed the ground staff.,Others
Phoning the call centre resulted in being told the check-in staff could assist.,Others
Arriving at Heathrow the check in staff informed us there was nothing they could do but ask at the gate.,Staff Attitude
The staff at the gate told us they could do nothing and had already told another family they would not be seated together.,Staff Attitude
"The only person who offered any form of assistance was a wonderful staff member at Changi airport on the transfer desk when we stopped,",Others
Not one British Airways staff member apologised for this.,Others
A request for alternative food was ignored repeatedly and staff were outright rude to passengers who asked for a landing card towards the end of the flight (I was told to go get it myself at the back of the plane).,Others
I complained to the staff at the gate and they said there was nothing they could do about it as the flight was full.,Others
"The staff were great,",Others
and staff seem to perform to a script - in some cases portray the feeling that because they wear a BA uniform they think they are so excellent - a sad fact is their standards are below several major European airlines.,Staff Attitude
"CSD (or whichever grand title they give to cabin staff) on outbound flight spent a lot of time giggling in the galley like a 6 year old child,",Lack of Staff
"Having encouraged passengers to check-in online and save it staff time and money,",Others
It reduces the number of staff for bag drop to the barest minimum.,Others
drinks only served when the staff were either not sleeping or chatting away.,Others
It was our tenth wedding anniversary not one member of staff said anything (I spoke with back duty office the day before and was told they would arrange a glass of champagne inflight).,Others
Check in at Tegel was a disaster and ludicrously (for it has a lot of BA flights) I was told there are no BA staff at that airport to sort out problems.,Staff Attitude
