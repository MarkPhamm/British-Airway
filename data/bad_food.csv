1,True,2024-03-01,United Kingdom,Boeing 777-200,Couple Leisure,1.0,3,False,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
2,True,2024-03-01,United Kingdom,Boeing 777-200,Couple Leisure,1.0,1,False,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
19,True,2024-03-01,Australia,Boeing 777-300,Business,2.0,2,False,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
22,True,2024-03-01,United Kingdom,Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,1.0,1,False,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
32,True,2023-11-01,United States,A380,Solo Leisure,1.0,1,False,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
40,True,2023-12-01,United Kingdom,,Family Leisure,2.0,2,False,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
46,False,2024-01-01,United Kingdom,,Family Leisure,1.0,1,False,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
50,True,2023-10-01,Spain,A320,Business,1.0,1,False,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
53,True,2023-12-01,China,,Family Leisure,1.0,1,False,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
56,True,2023-12-01,United Kingdom,Boeing 777,Business,2.0,2,False,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
57,False,2023-12-01,United Kingdom,Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,1.0,3,False,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
59,False,2023-12-01,Canada,A350,Solo Leisure,2.0,2,False,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
62,True,2023-12-01,United Kingdom,A321,Solo Leisure,1.0,5,True,"Check in was chaotic and badly organised. Even though there were two desks, one for premium and one economy, there ended up being just one queue, in front of the premium check in, even though most passengers in it were economy. That meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join. Whilst I was waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passengers, unnecessarily badly organised, the staff in charge should be retrained! Security at the airport was very quick and through to the lounge. This is a generic airport lounge for all airlines, and it is actually quite good overall. Nice layout and seating options, reasonable food and drink options, and an outdoor terrace which is really nice. Boarding was very well organised, although quite slow to get everyone on board.. but the flight was probably only half full and we still departed early so I think they felt no rush.. and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed. On board the club Europe seats are fine by European business standards, although as previously commented are really not very good overall.. the meal service was disappointing. As is normal, BA do not stock enough of the proper meal option .. when the options are so limited and varied in quality BA really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal. Sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so I had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad. I wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and I can honestly say it was one of the most disgusting onboard meals I’ve ever had in any cabin class, rolling some mush (similar consistency to mashed potato) into a sausage shape does not make it a sausage! BA you need to improve the meal options, make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passengers a choice of two decent meals .. then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice runs out! Whilst I hadn’t planned on using it, the on board WiFi was not functioning so was not available to use. Overall though the flight was fairly comfortable and the cabin crew were very friendly and efficient. I used avios to pay for the flight so it was obviously good value for money for me!"
68,True,2023-12-01,United Kingdom,,Couple Leisure,2.0,2,False,"Once again a terrible business class experience with BA. The flight was delayed by 4.5 hours, The plane was very old with problems with at least 4 of the seats in business class not cleaned properly prior to departure. Food was terrible as always with BA and only one choice available from advertised menu. As a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight from Heathrow and instead of putting us on the next connection they chose the second last flight of the day - which was also delayed by over an hour meaning we had an additional 4 hour delay whilst at Heathrow. At no point were we advised about our compensation rights (despite asking at check in and connections) or provided any vouchers during the delays. Having flown Etihad, Qatar and Virgin business class equivalents over the last year it is clear to see how big the gulf now is between BA and its rivals."
99,True,2023-10-01,United Kingdom,,Solo Leisure,1.0,1,False,"I flew from Istanbul to London in Business class. For more than half of the flight a child was watching an iPad very loud with no phones plugged in - it was three rows in front of me and disrupted my flight as I could hear it above my headphones. Staff thought this was fine and refused to tell the mom to turn it down. Why is this acceptable on a flight especially in business class? Has this airline turned into a zoo? Are staff given no training in customer service? Why is a child allowed to disrupt other passengers? When I told the staff she just laughed at me. BA customer service is a disgrace. I've not even mentioned the food but it was bad, really bad."
114,False,2023-08-01,United Kingdom,BA366,Couple Leisure,1.0,1,False,"Booked a very special holiday for me and my partner, September arrived and we were on our way to lovely South of France, Booked Business Class for us both to start the holiday right. As we were checking I was told the flight was over booked and our seats wouldn't print onto the ticket for some reason. We had already made sure the seats were booked when we had booked the flights nearly a year prior to going. Unfortunately when we arrived at the gate we were then told we would no longer be sat together and one of us would in fact have to go into economy. My girlfriend is an extremely nervous flyer and so had to take extra tablets to remain calm, She didn't have any food which we had pre booked also and she was sat right down the bottom end of the flight. We were held at the gate with another 4 or 5 couples all in the same predicament all due to the lovely money grabbing British Airways over booking the flight. They ended up refusing passengers in the end and even had people sat on the fold down chairs in the toilet area. When we eventually arrived in France late, we was waiting for our luggage to come. Our airtags stated that both our cases was in fact still in Heathrow. We then had to wait 4 days for them to eventually come into France by this point our holiday was ruined. British Airways was absolutely shocking, we couldn't speak to anyone as all the phone numbers were no longer in use. We felt stranded in a foreign country with no clothes and no one to help use with what to do next. Every day we watched them case not moved as we were tracking with air tags. it was so frustrating not being able to plan our days in hope we would get the call to then drive all the way back to the air port 2 hours each way to collect our cases. we ended up going out and buying new clothes toiletries and all the stuff to make the best of our ruined holiday, saving all the receipts thinking we would be able to claim it all back. how wrong I was. British airways take zero responsibility and fob me off with going through my insurance. British Airways only pay for basic essentials, Pants and toothpaste. I filed a complaint when I got back and requested my money back for business class and they haven't even had the decency to even respond. They are an absolute joke of a company and I wish they would remove British out of there name because there is nothing British about them. Do not give them your money, they cant even look after their staff let alone customers. Oh and don't bother trying to cancel your flight either as they just take all of your money off you and give you nothing back."
119,True,2023-09-01,United Kingdom,,Couple Leisure,1.0,1,False,"I take comfort in reading the last ten or so reviews to see I'm not the only traveller to put in words, how absolutely abysmal British Airways are! The only reason we are stuck using this awful airline is to use up points. We booked Club Europe months ago. London to Athens, sat in row 3 and told they had run out of food options, only choice was lentil pie or green curry. Returning Athens to London Club Europe. Couldn't check in online as promised so arrived at the airport 3hrs early. To be told they had overbooked the flight and basically we were being 'bumped' to economy. This airline fails to deliver time and time again. It is a national disgrace and I implore everyone to choose an alternative."
145,True,2023-07-01,United States,,Couple Leisure,1.0,1,False,"This is to express our displeasure and concerns regarding our flight to Italy. Our trip was effectively ruined by the failure of our luggage to arrive with us, coupled with the length of time it took for it to eventually reach us (9 and 12 days)! Our departure dates: June 19, 2023 - Flight BA 294, Chicago to London. June 20 rebooked by BA on BA 546, London to Rome. All flights were late. On arrival in Rome, my wife was forced to walk to the check-in desk because our reservation for wheelchair assist from the plane was never transferred by BA. She was told by the cabin crew that there was no reservation for her transport. Also, our checked baggage (2) failed to make the BA rebooked flight from London to Rome. BA took 9 days to deliver my bag and 12 days to deliver my wife's. I called BA Baggage Claim Services daily. I was frequently cut off after waiting on hold for over an hour. We had Apple Air tags in both bags, and sent pictures showing their exact location to BA Baggage Claim several times. After 5 days, BA stated that they found my wife's bag, but needed to verify ownership! Both bags as described had bright pink 4” easily visible tags and bright pink bows. Taking 9 and 12 days to deliver them is inexcusable. Our return date: July 3 - BA 553, Rome to London. BA 297, London to Chicago. All flights were late. We arrived in Chicago more than 3 hours late, missing our ground transportation to our home in Michigan (3 hours away). We had to find a hotel and stay overnight near Chicago. On July 12 we filed our expenses for replacement of lost clothing and toiletries, also for food purchased at Heathrow due to the flight delay and overnight hotel charges in Chicago. After 2 weeks, I went online asking for some follow-up on both cases, but have had no response at all from BA. We are retirees on fixed income, and cannot fund BA’s errors. I can honestly say that the times I was able to reach a human being, they were all courteous and attempted to help, but appeared at a loss."
148,True,2023-08-01,United Kingdom,A320,Couple Leisure,1.0,1,False,"Filthy plane, cabin staff ok, appalling customer service staff who couldn’t care less when dealing with a complaint. Paid extra for club Europe/business class. Food was poor, they gave you wipes to clean your seat area yourself and we were split up so they could accommodate families. Not really what you expect when you pay for the extra service. Will be cancelling our other bookings we have with BA, even if that means we lose our deposit."
183,True,2023-07-01,United Kingdom,Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,1.0,1,False,"My family and I have flown mostly on British Airways for the last 30 years. I am a priority passenger and fly often enough to recognise cabin crew and know some by name. They used to be a really good airline to fly with. Things have really deteriorated with their face to face customer care since the pandemic. The aircraft look worn. For example, on my flight back my audiovisual equipment did not work and had to be reset twice, finally working in the last hour before we landed. The second time around, I think the reset was done for the whole aircraft. The touch screen function on my screen did not work. The USB charger ports on my seat did not work. The staff were pleasant enough, but their service oozed mediocrity.  There did not seem to be much pride in what they were doing. The food has been the worst part on our BA flights since the pandemic. They gave us a menu, asked what we’d like, did a check and then told us that it was not available as they had run out and would we like to choose something else. They then told us that we’d get first choice at the second service which they couldn’t deliver on. Finally after choosing and getting whatever it is that we did, the food was tasteless. We take part in post flight surveys regularly and have stated all of this, to no avail. As a family of 3, we fly British Airways medium to long haul regularly, possibly 4-6 times a year each. For us, the good things about flying BA are that we are priority customers, usually have a direct flight to our destinations and get good service on the ground, when checking in and in the lounges when we use them."
215,True,2023-03-01,United Kingdom,,Couple Leisure,1.0,1,False,My husband and I booked seats within our premium economy booking. On both outward journey BA015 on 12 February and return on 11 March we were last OR almost last to be served food. Each time they had run out of our choices. On one occasion I did not eat as only available option was curry which disagrees with me. On all flights there appeared to be an undue focus on curry/spicy food. All in all very disappointing and left us with a very poor opinion of British Airways.
233,True,2022-09-01,United States,,Solo Leisure,1.0,2,False,"Words fail to describe this last awful flight - baby across the aisle crying for most of the flight and although horrible to go without any rest for the long flight LHR/SFO, it's understandable for a baby to cry nonstop - but the crew yakking loudly in the galley even after a polite notification that their conversation could be heard in the cabin - that made the flight unbearable for any rest or sleep (always difficult anyway westbound). The food was so bad that most  turned down whatever the nasty offering was on the 2nd service. What happened to the really nice tea and scones? I've said this before after suffering through the BA concept of customer service (i.e. don't do anything to help the passenger if it involves any extra work) - this time i swear i mean it - never again on BA please! The lounge was so packed even a single traveler had a hard time finding a seat - poor BA is on the skids downhill."
238,True,2023-04-01,United Kingdom,,Couple Leisure,1.0,1,False,"I wasn't going to bother reviewing this flight as I seem to be on a perpetual downer with BA but the airport experience convinced me otherwise. After having our flight class reduced from First to Business, then offered an alternative route on the outward leg in First to make up for the disappointment, they then reneged on this. As it was a special anniversary it sucked. Flying back we checked in online to our chosen window seats, at the gate we had to show our passports as we passport before boarding as we were hand luggage only. Trying to board we had our passports checked twice more and were issued new boarding cards for centre seats. Unbelievable! The flight itself was very quiet and only half the normal crew for this aircraft was unavailable. This meant no pre-departure drinks and a limited selection of food. The crew was great but what an earth is going on at BA, they have this unique knack to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory every time. I say this as the new club suites are great."
240,True,2023-05-01,Australia,Boeing 787-9,Solo Leisure,1.0,1,False,"I will never travel with British Airways again. I spent over $10,000 on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the UK. First, the Boeing 787-9 cabin has 7 seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy. The seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half. They have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet, which wakes up that passenger. The whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you. Second, the food was disgusting. Third, the service terrible. Fourth, the toilet was tiny. Fifth, the inflight screen was fixed and too high so I could not see anything. Sixth, their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for 2 hours and I had to pay more (no free airport transfers with British Airways). Seventh, the charging points did not work. The second leg to London was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisle. That was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece. This means that you are sleeping on a metal bar (the seat) where there is a gap in the seat. To add insult to injury I now find that both flights back to Sydney are on the small plane. To book a seat before check in is $170. I paid it but note that there were only 4 seats left. This is why I got the worst seat in the house going out. This is the most appalling airline service I have ever encountered. There is no point paying for business class in British Airways."
244,False,2023-04-01,United Kingdom,Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,1.0,1,False,"Regarding the aircraft and seat: The business class seats on this flight were pretty good. All were of the suite type, where every seat has its own booth with sliding door for extra privacy. The downside to this is that if you are travelling as a couple, its quite difficult to interact. There is ample storage and USB charging ports. The seat is pretty comfortable. As someone who finds it very difficult to sleep on flights, this was one of the only times I've been able to get a few minutes sleep here and there. The amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines. The leather toiletry bag was quite nice though. No slippers, only a pair of socks. The restrooms on the flight are very small, and don't provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines. No free Wi-Fi in Business Class is not acceptable. Another example of BA's penny pinching in recent years. Regarding the staff and customer service: Poor. Inattentive. Beyond meal times there was offer of water during the flight. I had to go and find an attendant and ask. There was also no offer of any snacks. Rude at times. My partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirty. The attendant was incredibly rude in response. This left us shocked. Different customers seem to receive a different quality of service. A customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were, whether they needed anything etc. whereas my partner and I were not afforded the same level of personal service. This is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of service. The food was pretty bad. I had risotto while my partner had chicken. Both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge. The vegetables were discoloured and flavourless. The bread was nice though. The breakfast wasn't much better. Summary: BA has become the Ryanair of long haul. The customer service is way below what I would expect for a premium airline in a premium seat. You pay a premium price for a very average service. If there are other options available I would choose them over BA these days."

The flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. Even though staff offered vouchers, we had no idea where to get them, and we were told that we only had about 10 minutes to use them because boarding had already begun. Firstly, I did not see anyone with the voucher, and secondly, even if we got it, we were not able to use it. When I finally got to the airport, there was another waiting for about 30 minutes after cross check. Meantime, we were told that due to problems, they did not load any food, so the flight will be without any food on board. The only food offered and given to everyone on the plane was a small bag of nuts. As a business class passenger, I was offered drinks only.

There was no inflight entertainment and the aircraft was very snug, when I challenged why I had to pay for my own drink and why no inflight entertainment - I was told it was a short haul fight. My sisters met me from Cairo (which is an hour and half flight) and flew Egyptair and somehow received luggage allowance, drinks, food and inflight entertainment as well as a USB port to charge their phones.

330,True,2023-01-01,United States,"A320, A380",Family Leisure,1.0,1,False,"Probably the worst business class experience I've ever had on an airline. Just a few of the issues: Required to purchase seats on international (Club World) business class. This was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional $600 on a single leg (LHR-LAX) for a family of four. Given the very strange business class seating layout on BA A380s, leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family. Ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft. On my VIE-LHR leg, the boarding time for the A320 was over 50 minutes long, leading to a delayed departure. There was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times. Severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite C of terminal 5 at Heathrow. Boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding (I have no idea why not) and so crowding was extreme. The overall boarding area was far too small for an A380, and I believe this satellite was designed and built after the first A380s were delivered. Online check-in in advance of flights appears to be completely broken. I was urged repeatedly (on the BA website, and via email and text) to ""upload my COVID documents"" even though, at the end of 2022, there are no COVID documents required for travel. After I filled in basic contact information on the website - and did not upload any ""COVID documentation"" - I was informed (several hours later) that my ""COVID documents have been verified"". I then received another text message urging me to ""upload my COVID documentation"". On the VIE-LHR leg, the shop.ba.com page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times - over six hours, and then four hours just before landing. BA lounges for Club Europe and Club World at Heathrow are often seriously overcrowded. Furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty. That said, the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality. The food quality in BA lounges at Heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline. Onboard, food and beverage service was far below average for international business class. Terrible, one might say. On the LHR-LAX leg, there was no pre-meal beverage service and there were NO mid-flight beverage services at all. Unlike most business class offerings on other airlines, there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight. Meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off, with the ""chicken or fish?"" type of meal selection similar to economy class. There was no coffee or tea service after meals. Food quality was poor, with the pre-landing snack of a ""ploughman's lunch"" being downright disgusting. . There was no beverage or bar set-up in the galley areas - beverages available to passengers during the flight - as is standard on most international business class offerings. Even bottles of water seemed be hidden away, requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water. I won't comment on the bizarre seating layout on the A380, as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating. The seats are not 6' 2"" long as stated on the BA website, and I found the seats too short for my 6' 2"" height. The ""Priority"" luggage tags were not followed in the baggage delivery."

My attendant saved me from crying. I don’t know who designed this aircraft but in this expensive business class, in order to move out of you middle seat to go to the bathroom you must rudely climb over the person’s legs sitting in the aisle seat. Your seat is like an enclosed tiny cubicle with no storage space. I’ve unfortunately traveled British Airways business class at least 4 times within the last 4 months.

Disappointing meal, wine served so late after the food you have finished by the time it arrives.

Great choice of cocktails, wine etc. Food ok a bit overcooked but pretty reasonable. Called to the boarding gate. Chaos, people jostling for position to get on the plane. People with children under 5 called before the 8 people in first bankrolling the flight and most of them well over 5. We get on to be told that none of the lights in first can be dimmed at all, so the lights were on all night. It was like being detained and interrogated! Excellent wine and champagne selection. Dinner menu handed out. I’ll have the prawn cocktail to start please. No you won’t as they’ve only loaded one for 8 people and the guy in 1A got it. I bet he felt like he’d won the lottery. Ok I’ll have the beef wellington, basically a freezing slice of beef with some lettuce. Mains,  I’ll have the curry, no you won’t as they’ve substituted that with Christmas dinner.  I’m going to the Maldives to get away from Christmas. I ended up with short ribs that were inedible, no salad starter, no water offered, no bread roll. I just couldn’t eat it.

Why have numbered boarding groups if you don’t use them. Cabin crew - Treated passengers as an inconvenience as they moved about the plane. At one point a passenger was coming out of the toilet as a crew member approached and the crew member just pushed the door closed pushing them back into the toilet as they went past, and without even a word. No acknowledgement when you stood aside to let them past. Service – We were in the final row of six in WT+ (which has a total of 48 seats). The lunch meal was brought out and we were the last people to be served (not unusual for back row seats) but when it came to us there was only the vegetarian option left of the 3 menu options. Cabin steward said that they had only been given 48 WT+ meals. There was a second hot meal served before we landed. Again, the same server got to us last and again there was only a vegetarian option left. I asked if it might not have been possible to commence serving this second meal from back to front so that we had a choice for at least one meal, and she said she hadn’t thought of that! Food – Some of it was inedible. Vegetarian Cannelloni had pasta so thick and uncooked neither of us could eat it. The bread roll was crispy like toast in the bottom half and soft in the top half. Only thing I could eat was the Baby Bel! In between meal snacks consisted of a 2 biscuit pack of shortbread, pretty basic. Drinks – They ran out of red wine 4 hours into an 11-hour flight. Toilets – There was no toilet accessible directly from the WT+ section. We had to walk halfway down the plane through Economy to reach a shared toilet. We flew Virgin Atlantic 2 months before in equivalent (Premium Economy) and it was so much better. Organised boarding, sparkling wine or orange on boarding (water or orange in BA), food options available (even in last row seats), better food, proper glasses/cups for drinks, dedicated toilet access, help yourself snacks, helpful service from cabin crew.

Bags also tagged incorrectly and had disappeared.  Someone ran off to find my bags in the depths of T5 and retag them (amazingly they did show up in Cape Town).  Told only main lounge was open not B and C pier lounges. Turns out this was false information ... B Pier lounge was open. But I was in main lounge which was overcrowded and worn out. -Arrived late to the gate (train not working). There was a Biz class lane (quick) but then a giant queue to get on the plane as they only had one airbridge, not two. Seat comfy and cabin clean but the sinks were taped up as the waste was not working. I was offered hand sanitiser instead but this is disgusting (imagine going to the bathroom and not being able to wash your hands as there is no sink). Unbelievable that BA dispatches planes in this condition. Food average. Wine served way too late (choice of wine with cold food, or eat food first and matching wines come a quarter of an hour later).

Minuses - The cabin was fairly cramped with six seats across. Each pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage space. It was hard to adjust the seat, particularly getting it to lie flat - even the FA found it difficult. The in-flight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films, TV programmes and music. The food choice and quality was poor - one of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible: the cheese selection was also poor.

The benefit of low cost airlines is they they don't hang around for latecomers, sadly BA is in a time warp over this. BA pilots used to be some of the best for updating status, but this has dropped dramatically in the last 2-3 years. The food standards and choices in the T5 First Lounge are one of the items that have been improved post Covid. Inflight service on this short 2h 40m flight was a light dinner tray, only 2 choices by row 3 - with 32 passengers in Club Europe only 4 salad options were available. No printed menu offered and the cabin staff explained he had only been given 10 menus for 32 customers. It appears there is no supply control in place at BA. Food quality was okay, but while Do&Co supply this, the Do&Co meals on Turkish Airlines remain superior to what BA manages (I flew Turkish 10 days ago).

A single drink was offered in plastic cups before meal service, and with the food you were offered wine only, but the crew 'could come back later' if you wanted something else - including water! I drank wine anyway but I wouldn't leap at this offer given how long it took them to do food. I've never experienced this on other airlines' premium economy products (I flew WestJet this year and they took your drink orders just after you boarded, then brought them to you before, and then with, your meal in glassware - brilliant! Air New Zealand do glass and use your name throughout). Water eventually came round after we'd eaten. As I say, the crew was pleasant and friendly but seemed under-equipped, under-staffed or following poor procedures. Food was forgettable. In-flight entertainment was great and the screens large - unfortunately after every seatbelt light announcement the screens' brightness levels reset to their retina-searing default. Not fun on a night flight with turbulence. Loos on this Gatwick 777 were halfway down economy (which was pandemonium) or at the very back. The upside to this layout is that PE is next to the exit, so we deplaned very quickly. Check-in queue at Cancun took forever. Couldn't see or hear gate announcements so everyone crowded the gate. Grateful for priority boarding in this situation. Bags arrived OK at Gatwick, no delay. I continue to avoid BA unless using Avios for business class or where there is no alternative. BA's problems all seem so easy to fix - their cabin crew are clearly eager to help you, why aren't they equipped and given service procedures to match other airlines at this price point?"

There was no option to get any of the other available flights. The business class lounge at LHR was packed with hardly any space to move. The aircraft was filthy with food wrapping papers on my seat and floor. The seats were uncomfortable. Food for business class passengers included bread rolls passed in a basket.

I wouldn't mind, but on European trips in 2022, BA are charging up to 3 times the fare levels of 2019, and the overall value for money is now very poor. The WiFi did not work from start to finish of the flight. Crew said it had worked on the way out and the Captain had contacted London to get it fixed on the return.

After the chaos of Cape Town Airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight. Boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne. The captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the 6.00 am lifting of the overnight jet ban at Heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so. This was no big deal. Then the captain announced that due to IT issues at Heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period. With the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for Business Class but this was not forthcoming. In the event take off was permitted quite soon after. The crew had distributed menus but then did a PA to say that there were changes to each of the main courses. A drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks, for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner. Drinks and nuts were served circa 45 minutes after take off, in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne. Dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler. The food looked bland, unappetising and tasted the more so. The cheese (two small pieces) were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney. No top up of the wine was offered (we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis) and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence. The flight was some 11 hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake. Breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner. Coffee or tea were offered by individual mug, orange juice was available on request. Cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items. Come on British Airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes. For the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort (flatbed) as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below 25% of the price paid for the premium cabin.

On boarding, we were surprised to find that the menu, amenity kit and bottle of water had already been placed in the storage drawer. We suspect this is another cynical time-saving initiative on the part of BA. Frustratingly, the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dishes were probably the worst we have ever encountered in any business class on any airline. The drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious basis of a passenger with a nut allergy. It's hard to avoid suspicions that cabin crew were being economical with the truth.

The poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine, which came filled to the brim. I mean it’s First Class, not a student house party. Neither had any knowledge of the wines on the menu. Most of the food was awful. My steak was dry, over cooked and tough, and whichever catering manger signed off on a canapé of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately. I will say, the cheese and port were nice. However the worst thing was the constant galley noise. There was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat (1K) which they were in and out of all night, and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming.

Even if weren’t, the Seat pitch and width is the same as economy. Gone are the little pretend tables in the middle seat to give some illusion of style. The food was dreadful. The in flight service was unsophisticated. BA used to have an acceptable European business class. They don’t any more. Other European airlines offer much better in flight experience in business class in comparison. BA is taking premium and frequent flyers for granted and treating us like mugs. How I miss the politeness of old BA business class from around 5 years ago, how I used to look forward to it, the small gestures like hanging up a coat, giving you a hot towel, having nice food, being served from the galley, rather than from the manky trolley.

534,True,2022-01-01,United Kingdom,Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,2.0,3,True,"Boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack air-con at the gate. The Club Suite cabins were about 3/4 full, but the rest of the plane can't have been much more than 20% occupancy. Whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say, but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins. Despite that, the drink and food service in business was efficient, and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after take-off, which is a real bonus on a night-time flight. However, the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible. The Club Suite is a big improvement on the ancient CW product, although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two. One definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old CW. The large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole IFE system was much more responsive. The new seats don't significantly aid sleeping, particularly as there's an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine. Waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets. Performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard and arrival was twenty minutes ahead of schedule.

I used the BA lounge in Terminal 3. Not very keen on the new table service. Poor choice and miniscule portions. Lounge staff were very nice in both directions. On arrival at LHR there was a coach transfer from T5 to T3. We were packed in like sardines. So much for social distancing. The flight from LHR to Pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another 2hrs 30 mins. Captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage handlers to load the containers. No drinks or anything offered while we waited. Food was not even worth mentioning. As far as Club Europe goes it's not worth the extra cost. No priority baggage as mine were last onto the belt in Pisa, seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off. The first officer summed it up when we arrived in Pisa- Sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by BA, and he was right. For the return trip on Hogmanay we left on time. I've never been on a flight to or from Pisa which has left in time. Pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable. On board I gave the food a miss.  Heathrow back to Glasgow Flight left on time. Food was an antipasto of some sort which I declined.  Both cases were last off again.

These seats are a huge improvement on the old yin-yang CW seats in terms of privacy, ease of access and the IFE screen, but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat. Storage was a mixed blessing, too, with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old CW, meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above. The food onboard was woeful, although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isn't dragged out. Cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm, and there were the usual queues for the toilets. The flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time.

Firstly - no lounge at all at Mexico City Terminal 2. There's a paid lounge, but the check in staff wouldn't help with the details. Mexico City Terminal 1 has functional lounges for AeroMexico working. Not good enough for an expensive ticket. Finally got to board and the staff are incredible - but throughout they were super apologetic as to what was to come. The food was literally inedible in First and staff offered commented as much every time. So for an 11 hour trip in First the option really was chocolate or crisps. The first suite on the flight had visible signs of wear and tear and needs some attention. The seat would not easily convert to a bed. It had scuff marks around it and generally looked a bit shabby. Again, not what you'd expect from a premium product. I left my watch on the flight in error and contacted BA immediately about this. Despite assurances that they have a comprehensive cleaning process during Covid my watch was never found. BA has outsourced their lost and found service to a separate company and in the process they have completely washed their hands on helping out customers. Given that I told them specifically where I'd left the watch I can only assume that one of the cleaning staff decided to keep it. All in all, you pay premium on a flight for additional service. BA isn't offering it at the moment. If it is essential that you have to fly really don't bother with first unless you have to - or go to another airline. The company just don't care."

Especially considering the very high cost of the flight (I've paid half as much less for business class returns to Australia). We got off to a bad start when offered one third of a glass of champagne (about 2 cm in the bottom of the glass). My initial drink after take off was not what I ordered, when I queried it, I got a lecture on this was how it should be. No wine arrived with dinner, until I asked for it a second time (out of stock of the first choice), no second glass of wine offered. Yes, I could have used the call button, but 1/3 of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a 10 hour business class flight? Other than the initial bottle of water, and a glass of water with dinner, no other water was offered until I got up and went to the galley to ask. The good news is the food was good and well presented. Although the promised (on the menu) selection of pastries with breakfast were not served (I later walked past the galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast). We had dutifully filled in the pre-order card for breakfast, only to find we were being asked again at breakfast. Sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high, I actually thought I had a fever (I was so drenched in sweat) until I spoke to a colleague who was the same. I'm used to flying ultra long haul with Middle Eastern airlines, so I'm used to hot cabins, but this was crazy. Only when the crew dropped the temperature a few hours before landing (presumably to wake us up), was it bearable enough to sleep. Combined with the a very dry cabin air, it was very unpleasant. No need to say anything much about the eight across seating as I know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years, other than they are very cramped if sitting next to a window. I do like the semi-reclined position for take off and landing though. I have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive. There is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down. Being on the second aisle, we had to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembark, so it wasn't quick. At no point did any member of the cabin crew introduce themselves other than via a general PA announcement. The seats I can forgive as they are being addressed, but the service was budget airline level. Really BA, you need to do much, much better.

Baby screams, could not sleep and as the cabin was full, they could not move me. The couple was very nice, apologetic and we just had to bear the 12 hours long haul flight together.

The service is very friendly, but not personal. I’m used to be adressed by my name when I fly business class.  While serving the meals, they forget serving me wine. The amount of cabin crew is not enough for a crowded business class cabin. After dinner I went to sleep. The seat is turned into a real bed, with an extra mattress and a good pillow. The space is narrow, it is difficult to make the bed. Once the bed is made, there is no place to put  personal stuff. I had a real good night of sleep though. If your seat is not at the aisle, you have to step over someones legs to go to the toilet. The toilets are small and simple, not cleaned frequently enough. When I woke up, breakfast service was running.  The breakfast is good.  Yoghurt, pastries, fresh fruit, and a full English Breakfast. Overall, British Airways World Club is a rather standard Business Class, lacks personalized attention and lacks the feel good experience.  If BA wants to compete, they have a long way to go.

Complained on return through BA exec Club webiste with response from Customer Service 10 days later. BA claims that overbooking is a very rare occurrence and gave a lukewarm apology. Evidence from ground staff on both journeys contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak season. We booked early so probably had relatively cheap seats. BA has presumably made money by selling our tickets to a higher bidder. General quality of BA service, food and wine has fallen dramatically over the last few years. BA is now effectively a low cost airline, flying a fleet of very tired aircraft, trying to preserve the gloss of a quality airline. The accountants may win in the short term but passengers will vote with their feet. Avoid this airline if you possible can.

Now I’m on the flight from Heathrow to Venice, no offer of coffee, water but worse, business class is just coach class, no extra leg room, just 3 seats with the middle one blocked out. Person in front of me put their seat back and my knees are in my chest. I didn’t pay for international business class to get stuck in uncomfortable seats for 2 long flights. I won’t fly BA again."

It is bad enough that BA persist using out of date airplanes, circa 25 year old B747-400's, but they perpetuate the dreadful ying/yang seating arrangement of Club Class, where you have to look directly at the passenger next to you, and raise a screen for privacy. Then, mid-flight the crew lower the screen to serve the food. To leave the seat, one has to climb over the legs of a sleeping passenger;~no mean feat in the dark. The crew from Chicago were appalling, and dumped the food upon us as quickly as possible. Breakfast was inedible, and I returned it uneaten. The lounge at O'Hare was a crowded, tiny, dirty facility, with a food bar including some wilted vegetables and crackers with cheese. Insufficient chairs, and a single, old TV. Does no one at BA care how BAD they have become for premium class passengers."

The British Airways First Class product doesn't come up to modern Business Class standards. This particular flight was late again, and the food / wine was simply awful. There is nothing remotely elegant about BA First Class, and the crew demonstrate no sophistication. This experience was like dining at your worst restaurant chain. Finally, not only is the aircraft tired and worn out, but the in flight so-called entertainment system did not work, and had to be rebooted twice. The First Class seat is a bad joke, and extraordinarily uncomfortable. British Airways are at least twenty years out of date with their entire First Class product. All that can be said about this airline is woeful. The Concorde First Class lounge at Heathrow is filthy dirty, and desperately needs refurbishment."

Returning from Bermuda to Gatwick we were presented with a worn-out Boeing 777. My seat table was broken with bits of seat plastic hanging off.

Reported this to steward who was clearly upset with my complaint and told me 'I'll put it in the book'. No apology, no attempt to explain, just irritation from him. The food was awful, neither my wife or I could finish it. It also seemed incomplete with no cheese and biscuits, and nothing to go on the salad. My wife's entertainment screen, didn't work, the passenger next to me screen didn't work and mine only worked intermittently. It look liked something from the Arc with the grid allowing the touch sensitivity clearly visible. I believe the 777s out of Gatwick are being updated, can't come a moment too soon. We purchased Premium Economy tickets for the this flight, we didn't get a premium service. Initially I was going to buy business tickets but the price was ridiculous so I'm glad I didn't.

Apparently it is necessary to pay extra to get a decent seat by priority booking despite having paid the full cost of world traveler plus. We checked in as soon as the online check in was available to find that only 4 seats (for the 4 of us) remained unbooked. We had to take 2 seats on the front row where the seats had no under seat storage and were as narrow as the economy seats, and 2 on the back row where we were constantly bothered by the adjacent toilets. Only 1 loo each side between the economy and economy plus meant that there were always queues of people leaning against us. Cabin pressure was uncomfortably low, overnight temperature was stifling hot and few people got any sleep at all. Breakfast was a hard cold half sandwich with a hurried cup of tea or coffee. Impossible to get any drinks or refreshments between the service rounds. Tatty seat covers, broken foot rest, malfunctioning entertainment, broken tables requiring us to hold our food and drink between our knees. When asked for help the stewardess told us she didn't have a screw driver to fix these things and it was an old plane with lots of this type of issue."

Ground experience not great - at LHR automated bag drop didn't work and it wasn't clear why; slow-to-react assistance eventually came and identified travel visa to India needed to be validated. At BLR, no online check-in available and slow process. Plane decor extremely run down and shabby, various pieces of the interior trim (bulkheads etc) rattling  and latches for bassinet shelves not locking. Row 12 so bulkhead seat and legroom excellent, however this comes with the hassle of not being able to leave anything on the floor for takeoff and landing; the stowage racks are never big enough to hold the blanket and pillow provided. Seat itself could have more width (I kept bumping the VOD control and I'm quite slim), recline limited and footrest could extend more. No USB power in seat which seems crazy in this day and age. VOD itself is atrocious; tiny screen (folding out of armrest on bulkhead seats), low resolution, visible gridlines and very little choice (hardly the latest movies). To top it off, on outbound leg the VOD stopped working altogether and resisted many resets. Customer service forms were handed out so I await the outcome of that. Food volume OK, quality poor (scrambled eggs in breakfast smelled terrible!), plenty of drinks on outbound leg but not inbound, cabin staff seemed indifferent on inbound leg.

It started well in the newish 1st Class lounge at the South terminal. However, the walk to the gate is miles. It has to be almost 1/2 mile walk which is a joke to be honest. The North terminal, where this flight used to operate from is not only a shorter walk for this flight, the decor and layout is much, much better. I'd guess BA got offered a cheaper deal to move to the S.T. My first impression was how badly the ""new"" 1st Class is holding up. There are scuff marks everywhere. Surface scratches. Bobbles of wear on the seat fabric. It's probably under 5 years of use but looks more like 10. In the WC there are small cracks in the plastic walls and brown stains. Needs a paint job at least. The motley flowers (That BA removed some years ago to save costs, but re-instated) are there. They looked like they had been pinched from a graveyard. Much has been said about the seat being ""an up market business class"" - and this is true. It is not a true 1st Class in the sense of what Emirates and Singapore Airlines offer. (I have flown both in 1st). The food is also business class quality. More casual dining rather than fine dining. Taking one meal; it starts with an Amuse Bouche. One motley round mozzarella bit of cheese. One tomato. One bit of green stuff. One straggly piece of prosciutto ham. Total cost about 30p. Outstanding! I then had prosciutto wrapped asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesan. Totally, utterly boring. My wife had the soup which she said was nice. I then had jerk Chicken dish. It was just about okay. The glassware and chinaware was okay. The cutlery was poor quality, the stuff you'd expect in Pizza Express, except the stuff in Pizza Express is better. I accept we are stuck with this 1st product for the next 30 years or so, but there is so much BA could do to improve the ""cheap"" look of their premium product. Quality of presentation, food, champagne, even the menu covers. They trumpet the ""superb"" Laurent Perrier Grand Siecle champagne, which retails at £120 a bottle. Its nice, but we all know this is inferior to what most Airline 1st Class offer in Krug. £20 a bottle more! The alternative to 1st is of course the ghastly ying-yang Club Business Class. The world's most hated Business Class in the sky. I'm a businessman and i know I could run this airline better, from a quality perspective. From a price perspective, if you bundle a 1st Flight as part of a BA holiday, it sort of works out okay-ish. The FAs as always were a very nice bunch of men and women."

Booked our return flight in Business/Club Class (at £1,000+ each) only to find BA want to charge an extra £80 each to choose our seats.  Awful seating with their Ying/Yang seating arranged like sardines in a tin. Poor cabin staff attitude - I asked for my seat to be made up into an bed only to be told ""We only do that in First class - if we did that for you we would have to do that for everyone in the cabin and we do not have the staff for that"". I was almost asleep when I was disturbed by food/drinks being passed through the serving hatch (otherwise known as a privacy screen) to the inner seat - This happened 3 times, a sort of sleep deprivation torture.

The seating arrangements leave little to be desired, i.e. if you are on the isle you're interrupted by the cabin crew passing food through to or collecting the tray from the person sitting on the inside of you (refer to seat guru for more understanding). Service is slow and once you have your food, good luck getting rid of your tray for about 45 minutes. If you're next to the window, you need to be extremely athletic to go to the toilet as you have to climb over someone legs in order to get out of your seat. The drinks available from the bar could not be less appealing if they tried and good luck trying to get one as the cabin crew are extremely elusive. If you do get a drink, be careful leaving it unattended on your pull out tray, I had two drinks slip off the Teflon type surface and spill all over my arm and seat. Dont get me started with the in-flight entertainment or the lack of it. After I watched two movies (on a 24 hour flight) I was scratching to find anything else decent to watch. The ""new releases"" is a contradiction in terms. There is very little priority giving to Business class when boarding the plane, sure you re called first but because of the plane’s configuration you ultimately have to join the queue to board with the rest of economy. Once you locate your seat you have all of economy filing passed you to get to their seats. I would not recommend BA to anyone."

There is a small storage drawer but nowhere to stow even small carry-on baggage except in the bin above. The food was at best pedestrian and no wine was served with dinner except by request and then it took ages to get. My husband got no cutlery on his tray and couldn't get the attention of steward to rectify (I gave him one of the two sets on mine). I, on the other hand never got the main course.

That after a night battling with intermittent service on the seat back screen,  a screen no larger than in Economy. The only benefit for the money was early off the plane with luggage prioritised to the collection area.

I booked World Traveller Plus or Premium Economy which costs appr. twice as much as economy. The flight to SFO was ok seat wise as the plane was an A380 and I has reserved an aisle seat. The food was disgusting for me, during the flight we were given a box with several pieces of junk food and shortly before landing given a piece of pizza. The choice of food leaves a lot to be desired. There were cold drinks offered regularly and you can go to the bulkhead to get extra if needed. We were offered maybe two hot drinks during the 12 hours on the plane (longer due to a delay leaving the UK). The flight back to the UK was worse since it was a Boeing 747 with the older bulkier seats. You couldn't even get to the remote control hidden in the inside of the seat and I'm not big. The recliner didn't work properly and the general space around the seat is cramped as the person next to me spilled over to my seat. I feel sorry for larger people. The food was just as bland and poor and barely any warm drinks. The staff seem challenged with certain situations. Next time I'm off to the US I will look for an alternative airline."

Middle seat fitted with a tray. Had a wonderful crew with 2 super professional stewards in business. Drinks served with a smile and the food also. Food reminding of what was served in economy 10 years ago when there still was free there. The best part of the meal was the cheese and pudding.

I am not sure where to begin. Food awful, I ordered beef (a showcase of British beef the notes said) that was inedible I left most of it. Instead of asking was something wrong or would I like another meal option, the FA took the tray away and asked if I wanted dessert. Wine 2 reds 2 whites and 2 champagnes - hardly a stellar wine list. Entertainment small screen with dreadful resolution and a very limited ordinary range of options. Staff challenged at best, clearly some had not been in business before. Disengaged and disinterested. The cabin was over hill for me. The toilet was not checked very often, a sweet wrapper remained on the toilet floor the entire trip as did an overflowing rubbish bin. I would expect much better up the front of the plane we pay a premium to be there and the service and overall product do not match expectations."

I have seen a change for the worst in BA service, and it does not seem to get any better. Bedding finally a decent pillow, a very good one indeed. The rest is a waste of money unless a new announced Club World seat is introduced where all this will fit perfectly.  Seated in a window seat makes it  impossible to make up a bed properly with them new things. I don't expect top food in a plane but I expect service. If you announce things, make sure you have them. On some flights Champagne is not being served when you have taken your seat. Premium economy however gets a sparkling wine.  You must eat when they order you to eat. They seem to have run out of certain items such as a gin other than Gordon's. You have to decide upon breakfast before you even had dinner. Entertainment, make sure you bring your tablet with downloaded things to view. BA offers you the most limited offer."

Booked this trip eight months previously and as I lost my status on BA a few years ago were forced to pay an additional £180 for our two seats. The flight I chose was a Boeing 787 and was prepared to part with the extra cash so we could be in the small front cabin. Never expecting anything to go according to plan with BA and our flight was cancelled a few days before. We were rebooked onto a later flight which they changed from an A380 to a twenty one year old Jumbo. We were then seated right at the back of Club World to benefit from a screaming child sat in the front row of premium. We were greeted by a rather pleasant steward who told us he would be looking after us for the trip, he then disappeared never to be seen again. Food was served within an hour of take off for an eleven hour flight. The steak so tough was it impossible to cut and could only be eaten by picking up and biting pieces off. After a few hours I went  to the galley to seek out a drink as the crew had disappeared, stood there being completely ignored by three stewardesses. Reluctantly one stopped chattering and managed to get me a drink. The second meal was served about seven hours after lunch, steak sandwich, at least that one was edible. The seat was as you would expect on such an old plane totally knackered, getting out was a task in itself. I bought WiFi for the whole trip, it ran for about 50% of the flight, yet their customer (non existent) services refuse to refund the payment even though I sent them a whole host of screenshots showing at various times there was no wifi service, but they are happy to note the problems. We have avoided BA now for some time, except where there is no other option as on Club Europe. But with transatlantic they are probably the bottom of the pile. We only took this trip to use up some Avios, they have all been used now and we could come back from LAX on Virgin Atlantic.

In my view whilst the Virgin product has improved, the BA equivalent has deteriorated such that Virgin is significantly better. Despite booking and paying for seats with BA this got changed without notification and we ended up in the back of WT+ on the A380 which are dreadful seats by the toilet with limited recline on an overnight flight. For the first time in many years I found the food inedible and the service not great (for example no cutlery initially on tray, no food choice as had run out of other choice, one drink serving and no where to get water on flight). Went through 3 layers of customer service with BA on seat booking issue but consistently fobbed off. Plane was also very warm so that in all a very uncomfortable return leg."

We weren’t expecting the long queue for Club Europe check-in, but mid-afternoon is apparently particularly busy in T5. Galleries South lounge was also teeming, but at least the filthy chairs had been replaced and there was a reasonable selection of hot and cold food. Group boarding was handled efficiently. The A321 was relatively new and clean, no pre-take-off drinks were offered. Departure was delayed by about 30 minutes but arrival was on time. The Club Europe section was unusually busy, with at least ten, fully occupied rows, including families with pre-school children. Despite the congestion and chaos, the food and drink service was handled efficiently, although the food was no better than the old World Traveller offering.

The leg room in Business Class in A320 is the same like in economy. The only thing that you get is an empty middle seat. The meal choices are poor: I had to choose between curry and fish pie. Also, they first brought us the starter and the dessert and after 5-10 mins (once we ate the starter), they took the starter plate and they gave us the main. The on board service, is less 'attentive' than some years ago (probably cabin crew are over-utilised and want to get some rest which is understandable). Also, due to the plane being late, the cabin was not cleaned properly. At some point we need to think why would someone choose BA over low cost airlines. Tickets are priced in a similar way, there is no food on board for the economy (while for business the portion and variety are a joke), leg space is small, there are always delays to depart from Heathrow (not BAs fault, but at the end of the day I experience delays). What is that makes BA in European flights distinct? Probably nothing."

Obviously heated up quickly but was lukewarm, dry and I was troubled by the fact it was delivered with no foil covering the food. Not the same as my husbands meal, so I have to take the airlines word LSML that it was low sodium. Attendants serving coffee missed us and when I pressed the call button it was over 15 minutes before a flight attendant showed up. One pass through the cabin for drinks. After that, you had to go to the back of the plane to find an attendant and order a drink. Sandwich served before landing in the evening was horrendous. Hummus, limp piece of lettuce and soggy thin sliced tomatoes made this stale sandwich unappealing and tasteless to say the least. I expected edible food and better, more friendly service with this airline. Our flight attendant was stone faced and seemed curt and bothered each time we asked about my missing meal.

Finally, BA has moved back into it’s own lounge which has been refurbished with new furniture. However, Premium Plaza still staff and operate the lounge. Food was ok – but the drinks choices remain poor. Slick boarding and a full PE cabin on a 777. Water and juice offered on boarding but still no prosecco offered on flights TO London. (apparently 3 are loaded in London for the O/W leg but none for the return.) Friendly mixed fleet crew who offered good service. Fast bar service followed by Veggie pasta or chicken stir fry offered which was foul. salty, dry and overcooked with reheated rice and mushy vegetables. The salad is a nonsense – a few leaves and a tomato slice. Pudding was sickly chocolate sponge thing which was gross. Got a couple of hours sleep. However the IFE froze after take off due to the PA system remaining locked on and preventing the IFE from working. A reset halfway through the flight worked, though two loud renditions of Delibe’s “flower duet” burst out throughout the aircraft twice waking everyone up. The standard T&Cs and juice and the pretzel roll with cream cheese offered before landing. I continue to be amazed this breakfast is offered as so few people accept or eat it given how awful it is. (BA should be embarrassed that it’s even offered) After leaving Toronto 5 mins late, we arrived 5 early at the gate at Heathrow which was welcome along with fast bags. For the return leg, I took the seasonal LGW to Toronto flight which was a couple of hundred bucks cheaper. An upgrade to Club World was a pleasant surprise. Fast check in at LGW but slow slow slow security – even in the fast track lane. Gatwick Airport sell £5 premium experience and so the lane was full of folk paying 5 quid mixed in with BA Fast track customers. Excellent lounge once again with a good choice of food, and champagne available as a help yourself. Efficient boarding and a great reception from the Gatwick cabin crew. A fast offering of champagne (with a top up) before take off though the old safety video was still showing. The Gatwick crew remind me of long haul crew from Heathrow – more experienced, faster and a more relaxed service than mixed fleet crew at who follow service to the letter which results in a slow and impersonal service. Fast bar service once airborne, followed by the old Biz food service. Overcooked steak (again) alongside jerk chicken and a veggie option. Plenty of wine and drinks along with T&C. After a pleasant 3 hour nap, I woke to afternoon tea which was the standard old offering minus the clotted cream – off the menu due to supply issues. At the gate early and fast bags too. This club flight was weird in that its hybrid in nature and in transition to the new biz service. So new toiletries and bedding but the old menu. I hope Gatwick catches up so BA don’t (unintentionally) promote two levels of Biz service with LGW being the poor relative. On the O/W leg, premium economy was in desperate need of a revamp. The food is truly awful – both dinner and breakfast, and it really wouldn’t take much to add better food, bedding and an enhanced drink service as BA really lag behind Air Canada on this route with premium economy. I do not regard the experience as a premium economy service other than the seat. All that said, I felt that BA is regaining it’s mojo with great crew, improved on board experience (cuts reinstated) and on time performance. Long may this improvement last!"

Fine Cornish champagne was offered and happily quaffed. The seat was OK, but not in the same class as the new AC J class pods, and not close to the Emirate's suites. Small things like the menu presentation, boarding sufficient food (there are a lot of seats in F), seat comfort (OK, but nothing special) and the toilets (small and curiously offering single-ply paper). The crew were very friendly; the service was decent in delivery, but poor overall. BA, your relentless drive to the bottom is catching up with you, and your First Class product is not worth the name anymore. One can only assume that BA are trying to phase it out as they drive any paying passengers to other airlines who place a serious effort to deliver a superb premium product. And no wi-fi"

Paid for the BA seat selection early to get good seats. BA canceled the flights (coming and going), BA did not inform AA or me that the flights were canceled. All of my text and phone number was entered with BA with my passport number. They should have contacted me. I found out a couple days before my flight because I happened to call to do a meal request. It turns out that BA shifted to smaller planes and I actually spent six hours, over two days trying to get flights on the days I needed to catch up with a tour. All they said is we can't help you. I kept calling and calling and got seats on the days I needed but they were the worst seats on the plane and because they were smaller planed, Premium Economy was awful. Food was terrible. We had pre paid $276 to choose seats. There were no good seats left. We ended up on a night flight right next to the toilets. Which meant the smell, people are bumping into you, the lights going off and toilets flushing for 9 hours. Same seats coming home. I would have been better off flying in coach. I have spent a month trying to get refund for the paid seat selection. I tried to get this before my return flight started because I was still calling and calling to get seats away from the toilets on our return flight and to get our refunds.They wouldn't refund. After returning, I made five phone calls and spent 30 mins filling out a detailed request online. Called again today, was disconnected twice and told there is nothing I could do. It is possible I may get a response in a month regarding my email request. Don't ever fly with them! They used to be the finest airline in the skies but now their system is broken and there is no such thing as customer service. If you have a problem, you will be up a famous creek without a paddle. They have an endless loop of calling, waiting on line, their agent's can't or won't do anything but sell seats. I spoke to many many supervisors, no results. There is no one to solve problems. They pass the buck, have you fill out forms online and no one responds."

Champagne was conspicuously lacking. Toilet paper wasn’t being refreshed in the toilets and here was no lock on one of the cubicle doors. There were no information screens, so one had to wait for the tannoy call to board. Boarding itself was efficient, with priority for groups 1 and 2. Seats 62J/K on the upper deck are the best of a mediocre job, and at least there's plenty of storage space in the window bins. Take off was on schedule. FAs went through the motions, with little enthusiasm. The food was the worst we've ever experienced in Club World. The 'smoked chicken salad' was atrocious and the 'scrambled eggs with chives in a tortilla wrap' deserves to be in a museum of culinary horrors. The White Company bedding was a let-down and far removed from the luxury portrayed in adverts. There's little one can do to remedy a hard seat. Landing was ahead of schedule. Overall, a lacklustre flight in an ancient plane with a sub-par business class product. British Airways are falling ever behind their competitors."

Business Class is utterly outdated, with the weird ""facing each-other configuration"", and narrow / uncomfortable seats. The food served was appalling. The cabin crew were inattentive at best, and appeared disinterested in providing genuine customer service. The problem with British Airways now in First and Business Class, is what they are completely lacking: namely, any class or manners whatsoever. Poor food, uncomfortable seats, terrible / small movie screens, No WIFI and an overall budget airline experience. British Airways even charge for seat selection too, which adds insult to injury. Avoid this horrible airline if you can. The only redeeming feature of this  airline is the wonderful, quiet Airbus A380. A shame BA ruin the aircraft with such a poor quality product and attitude."

Return flight BA 292 was delayed by late arrival of inbound flight, but no worries could relax in the PE cabin, boarding the aircraft and turning left for the first time ever immediate disappointed, how old was the plane? The cabin was dull and those seats looked as though they had seen better days, a quick check and this particular 747 was delivered to 1998 and hadn't had the refurbishment treatment. Leg room was a tad better than economy but seat controls not very efficient and as for the IFE system that decided not to work, mind you the screen was so small and scratched I doubt I would have been able to watch anything. Cabin crew offered a pre take off drink water or orange juice and a hot towel that had seen better days, it was the sort of thing that you clean your car with, after a few words from the Captain we departed. The evening meal was some sort of chicken with rice with real cutlery and was ok, wine and G&T was acceptable, about 1 hour before landing breakfast was served or should I say offered some sort of filled roll. I declined and had a tea in a paper cup and nothing more offered. I should add that the cabin crew were very attentive and tried to make us feel a bit special, for having spent an extra £400 for the upgrade.

Wines which were the best in the sky when Jancis Robinson and Hugh Johnson made the selection (apart from a good white champagne, but mediocre rosé) are at the level of a business class. And my seat did not have sound from the audio/video system: so they moved me. And an hour later the whole system stopped without the crew apologizing. Needless to say no wifi! Apart from their LHR First and Concorde Room lounges at LHR which remain great, BA is now no better than a 3 star airline. Sad for the clients and shameful for BA management."

Boarding was a scrum as there was no priority given to Club Europe passengers. The flight wasn’t full therefore service was quite prompt. I found the crew to be quite engaging and friendly and were happy to talk to. The food was quite mediocre which consisted of afternoon tea scones and miniscule sandwiches. One passenger wasn’t very happy with the serving and the crew tried her hardest to explain what afternoon tea was. Business class was quite average to be honest. Will fly Club Europe again maybe depending on which route and price. BA has a lot of catching up to do compare to other carrier within Europe.

Unprofessional staff, uncomfortable seats, foot rest but no leg rest, very little seat recline and difficult to operate. Rubbish food, very poor landing and everything went flying. Additionally, we were a family of 4 travelling together but split up and 3 of us were seated between two of the four toilets that serve 160 people. These “premium economy” seats are directly outside the toilet doors which meant an entire night kept awake with the noise and light from the loos. Other airlines have toilet lights that dim until you lock the door to avoid flooding the cabin with light - not BA. Even the staff kept leaving the toilet doors open after they went in to blow their nose or check their teeth or makeup. This was the second leg on a flight from Sydney (via LAX) so we were beyond tired. When an attendant picked up my son’s water at the end of the very long and sleepless flight, he didn’t hear my son say “thanks” (which he had) so the attendant said pointedly “You’re welcome - rude!” and laughed about it with the passenger next to him. In my experience, better (and cheaper) premium economy can be found with Norwegian, Air New Zealand and American Airlines - all of whom also allow seat selection without additional charge. I’ve never had cause for complaint with any of those airlines but with British Airways, I’ve never had a good experience."

I have travelled in all classes except First. BA used to be a very good airline and stand out from most but now they look like a low cost airline with high cost fares. Not value for money. The food and drinks are parsimonious to the extend of me having to ask for a drink, even in Business (I flew out Club and returned Economy plus). Staff on board are still the usual arrogant and discretely rude, no changes there. Boarding has become indifferent and they group classes in 5 different queues of travel so we have become just a number. Service is not exclusive anymore. Seats on the 777-300 wear hard and uncomfortable including the beds on CLub. Their lounge performance is very poor also with food option variety (in case of food allergies/intolerances) really bad and of poor quality. It is a shame Singapore Airlines doesn't fly to Brazil from the UK as they definitely offer top quality service especially on their business class. BA has become mean, greedy and indifferent to their customers and I feel it is time for the CEO to go as he is ruining the image of the airline. The changes on baggage weight has become silly also. I was allowed two luggages of 23kg. Any sensible person would allow me to pass with one luggage at 27kg and one of 10kg as I haven't go above the allowance I am entitled. Instead I had to reshuffle my contents from the big luggage to the small luggage to make it 23 and 14. In my opinion unnecessary as I had 37 kgs in total and not 47kg! So I will in future re-think my trips to Brazil. Even if I have to make my journey longer as I am after good service, value for money and a differentiated experience. Thumbs down to BA."

The cabin is very dated, and cramped, it wasn't clean (half a biscuit down the side of my seat and plastic bags on the floor) and the service and food were average at best. Why in this day and age do BA persist with having seats with no direct aisle access? Not that I could get comfortable enough to sleep anyway, the seat was adequate and no more, the entertainment system screen was small and the touch screen was very clunky, needing very firm contact to get any response. On top of this there was no USB point to charge my phone! I expected better cabin service than we got, not offered tea or coffee after dinner and it seemed to be a case of asking for anything that was needed rather than being offered it - I certainly don't expect to have to remind the flight attendant about the cup of tea requested 15 minutes earlier.

The bar on board was supposed to have full range of mid flight snack and sandwiches but apparently they ran out and the reason from cabin crew said people are taking too much food.

When it comes to meal choice, the main course I had selected (non veg Indian dish) was not available. When questioned why? - I was told, ""sorry, today we only loaded 3 of those dishes, and other passengers have already ordered them. Therefore, please select another option"". So, I skipped the main meal. I reminded the stewardess that I am not an upgrade passenger, I paid full price. It is shame that BA is flying with less than 50% food choice for their premium passengers.

They ran out of champagne and some of the food was even served cold. The cabin crew were generally unresponsive and didn’t seem to care much about providing a decent service to premium clients. Overall it was probably my worst experience in business class and the new BA concept doesn’t seem to work well (it was even criticised by the crew during the flight).

The lounge looked like council offices hugely disappointing and the food offerings were not good. On board was no better a scrum at the boarding gate so not called first - was followed by a filthy seat, a screen that wouldn't stay up and a meal service that even the very nice onboard staff apologised for as she put it in front of me. Our return in Club from New Orleans was not much better, no separate check in no lounge but a $30 voucher to use in the one bar that is still open at this time of day again a filthy seat and a broken arm rest.

They were waiters and waitresses at best, and didn't seem to have the social skills requisite to serving business people. Club Class on this route was also full of screaming children, one of whom threw up on the flight. WHY do BA hold their premium customers in such contempt?

The BA premium is product nowhere near as good as other operators economy offering. The promised fine China dining experience only relates to main course. All other food and drink was served in plastic. The entire meal came on a cluttered tray, dumped on to tray tables with no finesse whatsoever. The chick pea starter was icy cold, the main course lamb over cooked, tasteless and inedible. Dessert and cheese portions were minuscule. Entertainment screen was marbled and very small. Reformatting films to fit to near postage stamp proportions made viewing impossible. Breakfast service made no pretence to premium service. Served on plastic and to be eaten with plastic cutlery.

Took nearly 2 hours hanging on the phone before anyone would reluctantly agree to rebook me onto another flight. Was told club seats weren't available on the only flight with seats departing within 7 days so reluctantly accepted economy seats. Was told I couldn't have a refund of the difference between club and economy. Looked at BA site later that day and club seats were available on the flight they had re-booked me onto. Called back but they refused to put me in the cabin I had paid for saying I had volunteered to downgrade and I would have to pay to upgrade (£600 each) plus pay an admin fee to upgrade to a service they were trying to charge me twice for.

Friendly FA showed me and wife to our seats. Looked freshly cleaned. Pushed back on time. 1st Class was full. Airborne I had dinner: Mezze to start which was nice. Some chicken thingy for mains - which was horrible. Cheese and biscuits to conclude. Wines were ok. The seat (the new ""First"") - is not wearing well. Looking somewhat tired. Managed to get some sleep on the ""bed"" with the usual duvet and blankets. I am a tall guy and need the space. the Club World option is horrendous. Very pleased to confirm that Mr Alex Cruz (BAs CEO) has re-introduced flowers in the 1st WC. Readers will recall he cancelled these last year to save costs. If Mr Cruz wants to save costs he should get rid of the gas guzzlers 747-400s. So a full 1st cabin will generate about £40,000 of revenue. The flowers (for 2 WCs) probably cost £8.00 - so, pleased to see the airline is still flying and not gone bankrupt over the re-introduction of eight quids worth of flowers per flight. The 1st product is very mediocre compared with say Emirates. Some have said its ""sort of an upmarket Business class"". I'd agree with that. One would think, BA would want to make a big impression on this route - with at least some high end food. ""Logic"" is not something BA seem to understand - given the high level of negative reviews on this site. Very disappointing."

My friend had beef and so did I - when challenged on this I was told - only 3 beefs aboard! This flight was again full and had been for weeks. 14 people. 3 beefs. A joke. My wife had an Arab dish which she did not like. When it came to coffee, my friend, then I - had a choice of chocolates. My wife then had the box offered - only to have it more or less demanded back by a pushy FA. Most BA cabin staff are good - this one was a PR disaster. Flight was smooth all the way home.

London to Washington  was on a broken down 747, seat sofa which you are supposed to lie on broke down and caved in on the floor. Had to be moved twice before they found functioning seat.

After reading very mixed reviews here, I also saw that BA were upgrading standards on flights to NYC in particular and was looking forward to my flight. Should not have been so optimistic, as this is still a business class that belongs in the 1980's. Aircraft was tatty to be polite about it, worn carpets, seat with various malfunctioning or broken items, washrooms grimy from the word go. Staff tried hard to offer a modicum of good service, but the so called food improvements were really not much better than other premium economy cabins I have flown when I have to pay for the ticket. BA talk a lot about their premium standards, but even when you pay to-dollar for business class the standards are well below even their US counterparts. Complete rip-off sums it up."

The cabin interior was worn and quite grubby, the seats terrible and now must be one of the poorest for long haul business class. The meal and presentation is really a joke, and on my previous long haul biz trip I got better food in Lufthansa premium economy. Cabin staff were quite friendly although they do hide in the galley a lot. Chatted to one of them who said so many customers are complaining and even deserting BA because of the fall in standards - I'm not surprised and I for one would not use them again for long haul. Time for senior management changes, as the present CEO clearly has no clue how to run what was once a premium airline. Now, they do little more than a low-cost and easyjet for one is far superior and nicer for short hops in Europe."

The catering service was absymal, no choice of hot meal; hardly a bar service and no tea/coffee - I suspect although the aircraft arrived empty from LGW, they hadn't fully loaded the food & drinks trolleys.

Crew could barely serve me, ventilation was restricted and access 100% blocked by the foot rests of forward facing passengers. Once the security screens went up I felt like I was in some sort of flying crypt and was tempted to assume brace position to give the impression I had died and was on a viewing.

The usual selection of dry sandwiches, and a chicken noodle soup (minus the chicken and noodle). The lounge was clean with plenty of staff clearing away. Efficient boarding with sparking wine/soft drinks offered. Early departure, fast drink service and dinner before lights out. There was no breakfast (previously scrapped) with the cereal bar now also gone. Early arrival, a short wait for a shower in the North Lounge, followed by an ok breakfast. An early departure and an average flight on a A319. Long queues for the bathroom (only one now for all of economy as the other was removed to provide 2 more seats) with slow buy on board service though at least they made it to the last row mainly down to little take up of food or drink. Early arrival though a long wait for bags. Oslo to London on a A320 was verging on a farce, A full flight, selfish use of the overheads delayed departure whilst crew looked for space. The buy onboard came out quickly with one and then the second handheld machine dying at the first row served. Service ground to a halt whilst the crew tried to get either machine back into life, broke out the paper visa slips, took the cart back in, re-appeared 20 mins later so service started an hour into the flight. Little take up as people had given up including me as there was little time left to enjoy the purchases. The crew tried really hard, put a brave face on and kept going. The organisation and concept of the BA buy on board is a disgrace. Though a third party provides the food and card machines, the choice, stock holding and the reliability of payment machines means the service is a farce.  I don't understand why BA continue to struggle with this service as Easyjet, Ryanair and low cost carriers seem to have have to cracked it and got their act together. Early arrival and fast bags completed the flight. Final flight home to Toronto was good, the club lounge at the B gates remains quiet, clean and an oasis to relax and eat/drink before flying. The 787 was towed to the gate 45 mins before departure and was never going to leave on time. At the gate, the experience was enhanced with an upgrade to business class. Service was really slow on boarding I had to ask for champagne, and the underwhelming bag of toiletries and shades only offered after take off. We pushed back over 30 late. No signs of life from crew for another 30 mins, though a positive enhancement was tray service for drinks which felt more classy than a cart. The main of steak was excellent and looked to be on new crockery and plated after cooking (no dried gravy or potato around the edges). Afternoon tea remains underwhelming with no scones and only three sandwiches still wrapped in plastic. Overall, the decline in service seems to have stopped with some minor improvements. The crew on all four flights were pleasant but lacking confidence and experience. The desire to do things by the book results in slow and wooden service at times. Other than the farce of buy on board, I was pleased there appeared to be no further decline in service."

Onboard, seats are old and tatty, cramped and uncomfortable and offer no privacy whatsoever. The food was passed across my neighbours seat to reach me, and what a lousy offering this was - below many airline economy meal standards. IFE screen was not working properly, fuzzy and very poor. Cabin crew were polite and trying to be friendly, but they certainly hide in the galley as soon as they can and judging from the standard of the toilets towards the end of the flight, they do not see it as part of their job to maintain these.

The TV monitors colors are so off. it was a nightmare trying to enjoy any movie. Getting the brightness right to make the colors work. Because if you don't want the monitor to blind you when it's snooze time, good luck watching the movie in any other color than black and red. The worst thing was the food - salad was frozen. The beef filet was so dry and flavorless but too salty. My partner's chicken was swimming in a pool of oil and flavorwise, it was hitting all the wrong spots. They believe in Umami and dump a ton of MSGs on their food to make it taste edible but did they get that wrong. I ended up eating bread and butter only. Same goes for the scrambled eggs for breakfast. Bacon was extra salty.  And the fresh fruit bowl was just as frozen as the salad. Overall, very poor and disappointing experience."

The journey started in the Concorde lounge Dubai and it is a very small area with little food that in the two hours I was there was not refreshed. Onboard the 777 you begin to sense the jobs worth attitude of the staff who seem to permanently work to rule. Amazingly when the menu came it contained only an Arabic snack with no options. They say this is to allow maximum sleep. No other airline has done this. Breakfast was undercooked slop and it was inedible. It is incredible that you can spend 10000 usd on a ticket and you can't even get a meal. The airline is clearly failing fast and I wish now I had flown the luxury of Emirates at half the price. Very disappointing and they don't care.

First meal service has Thai Green Curry (veg) and the second Thai Red Curry (chicken). Really? No one could come up with two Thai dishes that were a little bit more different? So the meal service begins and I was going to have the chicken satay starter and main course salad with grilled prawns. Unfortunately the chicken satay dish has been replaced by a prawn dish which turns out to be every ingredient from the chicken satay apart from the chicken and obviously with prawns.  I said, ""I don't want the prawns for starter as I'm having the prawn main meal."" I should not have worried as the prawn salad was off.  Ok so prawns for starter and I'll have garlic herb crusted chicken breast with onion sauce, mashed potatoes, mushroom, spinach and tomato. Well I'm not sure how they did it but the potatoes were disgusting to the point I wasn't eating them. The chicken breast was dry and I got no hint of herb or garlic or chicken to be honest and the onion sauce could not save it even if there had been enough of it. Mushrooms were very meh, tomato and spinach were fine but all in all inedible. The bread roll didn't win any prizes either. I just gave up and refused to eat it. Now when this was served I'd been drinking rose champagne and wanted a glass of chardonnay but the FA was off too quickly. No problem, press the call bell. Which is reset before anyone comes. Press it again and think I'd better get on with eating my food. Eventually some one arrives and notices I'm not eating my main course and after I tell them it is disgusting I ask why no one has answered my call button. Obviously I'm just asked what did I want and I say it was the wine but it is a bit too late now and I'll have port instead as cheese and crackers will be my next choice. This does not appear for fifteen minutes. During that time I am offered the vegetable thai green curry to replace my inedible main but that isn't going work for me. So a couple of hours later I'm a bit peckish and go to raid the club kitchen where I find some quite pleasant snacks. Back at my seat I think I need a G&T with this but ten minutes later no one has arrived or even been in our cabin. There is no one in the galley galley between the two club world cabins and indeed no member of staff in the larger CW cabin. I do find one in the second galley. I ask and my call button is tested and appears to be working but three times I've tried to use it and been ignored. Bad service. Now on to the second meal service. Strangely there appears to be no choice unlike stated in the menu. I ask the FA about this but am just told everyone is having the same, no explanation. The starter turns out to be smoked salmon with a wasabi dressing. The dressing is tasteless but salmon is fine. Now this is a pity because my choice of main was going to be a meze that had smoked salmon as a major part and now I have to choose again. Ok main meal, I'm give a choice of smoked salmon again or red Thai curry so no choice really and I decide to give up and go to a restaurant when I disembark. Just not recommended at all."

On the return Club flight in particular, the purser told us on the tannoy that staffing levels were low so service would be slower; on 3 occasions I had to ask for a G&T, eventually I only received it by going to the galley. It was made clear by the staff that they resented my interrupting their jokes and conversation. Food in club was average. First lounge in T3 not great: sole Elemis spa person decided to take an hour off from 1840-1940 (leaving a scribbled paper sign saying ""back in an hour"") which wasn't helpful given several long haul flights were leaving at 9pm. When I tried to book an appointment on her return, she told me she was busy and full (whilst checking Facebook on her iPhone).

In fact, I've had superior travel experiences on some budget carriers. Flying from Vancouver to London on the A380 was superb, it's a wonderful aircraft. Beyond that - atrocious. Dinner was a tough piece of chicken, over cooked vegetables and dried up rice. Breakfast was a farce, a dry bun with a smearing of cream cheese and a granola bar. Hardly suitable breakfast fare. The entertainment options were far inferior to what they used to be and the crew were unsmiling, disinterested and inattentive throughout the flight. No snacks, no water offering between meals; nothing! On the same route, Air Canada is superior in every way.

All looked good until the gate crew lost control of the gate on seeing the door to the jetway open passengers surged forward and then blocked the entrance while the calls made for First, Gold, Business etc to come forward. It is not pleasant to have to to push forward to get to the gate as a BA premium passenger. One First class passenger told the gate assistant to ""take control back of the gate"". She blamed the passengers when actually it was just poor gate management by the staff. It was a miracle then that the flight departed on time and arrived into Accra a little early. A first for me in 18 years on the route! Once on board the crew on the top deck could not have been more friendly.

I flew on the 777 so whilst it's not the newest plane in the fleet, I still expected some level of comfort. The seats are too narrow and do not lie flat. I'm a slim size 8 and could not turn around in my seat. There is a footrest that comes down to form the end of the bed, but does not line up with the rest of the seat. So your feet are raised. The armrests are narrow and hard and wobble around. Every time the person next to you moves, your chair moves too. The hydraulics must be connected. It was very annoying. The tray table was not well supported and when pulled out of the arm rest, it sloped down and so drinks/meal tray did not stay put. It was not secure and basically, was flimsy and unusable. I had to use my inflatable neck pillow to support it on my lap. I was in seat 14A which was a rear facing window seat. There is a plastic divider between you and the seat next to you (which is a forward facing aisle seat). The divider has to stay down until you are airbourne. So for the first 40 minutes or so whilst the plane is boarding, you are staring a fellow passenger directly in the face. Very awkward! The tv pulls out of the side column and mine wouldn't stay put. It wanted to go back into the column and so I had to watch my movie at an angle. The food. Well. The fillet streak was tough and dry. I had a similar dish flying out to the states on a 777 with American Airlines and they did a much better job. The selection of wines was good and the key lime pie was nice. Service: if you want good service, don't get a window seat. You are cut off from the aisle, and with the plastic divider up between you and the opposite passenger, the cabin crew forget you are even there. I had to ask for a drink when the trolley went round, both with dinner and breakfast. The layout of the seats also makes it tricky for the cabin crew to pass you your drinks and food as they have go above the opposite passengers head! Not ideal with some turbulence. There was also no wifi even though BA advertise as such. Apparently the Boeing 777 does not have the right equipment. In short, BA have obviously prioritised cramming as many small seats as possible into business class cabin. The layout is impractical, seats are narrow, there is an awkwardness with an intimate view of the fellow passenger, and the layout also means that your not clearly visible to the cabin crew and so get ignored. The 777 is an old plane and definitely needs modernising to ensure that the seats are working properly, the TV's stay out of their sockets so you can watch a movie and the tray tables can support your meal.

This is always a busy flight with passengers taking on loads of cabin bags. Ground staff only started to collect excess baggage from people with 20 mins to boarding and so there was no room on board for all luggage. Chaos in economy class. On this flight it does not work when the flight is boarded with anything less than 1 hr to departure. When will BA realise this flights needs at least 60 mins to board - it is the most delayed flight out of Heathrow because of this poor management. Fact. The ground staff did nothing to control the crowds - simple and polite requests would have helped. The grand staff were downright rude and grumpy with their passengers - on one of the money making flights for the airlines they need to up their game and just be polite (even if they do not enjoy their jobs or dealing with passengers). Once on board the crew were friendly and professional. Very friendly but this does make up for old aircraft in need of a good clean and refresh along with poor in flight entertainment, poor food and very poor quality seats.

Was instructed at check in that this was a “sleeper service” and I should eat in the lounge. Not an advisory but an instruction. The Club World food on offer in the lounge for the “dining experience” was overcooked and of very poor quality. Usual Cub World service on BA which involves clambering over people to get out to the aisle, poor food (they did offer food), poor in-flight entertainment, putting the inflight divider down but never putting it back up (BA train your staff if they put the divider down to have the good manners to put it up again) to serve food and drinks.

I have been flying BA on my many trips over the last six years, and I have seen such a shocking decline in their services that I feel compelled to write this review. Of my six flights this year, three were seriously delayed. One was from Oslo to London on 9th June, when the captain decided to wait  for some Business Class passengers who hadn't made their way out of the lounge in time for take-off. My worst experience, however, was going to Hong Kong on 30th May, when there was a technical fault with the plane. The captain decided to board passengers at the scheduled time, who then sat on the plane for almost three hours, without being offered any water or other refreshments, and with little information and apologies, before an 11-hour flight. I was in Premium Economy, but the extra amount I paid did not offer any additional comfort. I switched my seat to help a disabled passenger and ended up in a seat next to the toilets, which meant that I got no rest during the night. How can Premium Economy seats be next to the toilet? The in-flight service was poor, as nobody came around to offer water or beverages during the night. I am still wondering why anybody would pay for Premium Economy, as it is just a lousy offer: seats are only marginally more spacious than in Economy (but don't recline as they would in Economy), the food is the same, which means rather bad, and the flight attendants are clearly not interested in offering service beyond the first two hours of the flight. Predictably, the plane landed in Hong Kong just in time (below three hours' delay) for the airline avoiding to have to pay compensation to passengers on this very uncomfortable flight. I had hoped to have a better experience on the return flight on 4th June, but then I found out that BA had scrapped the sparkling wine as a welcome drink for Premium Economy passengers. Although this time the flight was on time, this gave me such a bad feeling about BA, their cynical attitude towards their passengers and their meanness. I will look for alternative airlines from now on and would recommend to avoid flying with BA."

My special meal was not on board however the crew member in the premium cabin was very obliging and a crew meal was provided for the short flight. Leg room was atrocious for Business Class and seats are the same as economy. Because the curtain could not be drawn, the Business Class toilet was used by Economy Class passengers and at times Business passengers had to queue behind them. Given the high expectations following the experience on the ground the plane was not up to standard however the service provided despite these lapses was great. Had to wait for about 20 minutes for bags despite being the only aircraft at Genoa Airport. In all this was not a Business Class quality flight, we should have flown economy for a quarter of the price."

The cabin crew did their best, but they know they are now providing a very inferior product compared to other carriers. Cut backs are evident everywhere, from the small and very cheap hot towels (offered only once during the ten hours flight) and the nuts (presented in a packet, other than with other airlines on china and warm - this might seem a small niggle, but it is indication of BA saves costs - by annoying their premium cabin customer). The amenity kits, presented in a shoe bag, is a joke really. To be honest one gets a better premium cabin product from other One World members (Royal Jordanian and Qatar for example). Flight left and arrived on time - but the airline should be more than that. The offering within the flight needs to be competitive and regain some ground. Was presented, at the second meal serice, with frozen pawns on bread (returned and a de-frosted plate came by return). Unsure if prawns being frozen and unfrozen as a good idea - but no effect as yet. Part of the seat was covered with food from the previous flight, I covered it up with a spare blanket. Despite there being enough toilets for Club World passengers there was often a line of people waiting from World Traveller Plus - snaking past seat in rows 15 and 16. No control of passengers from World Traveller Plus coming in to the Club World cabin. Toilets were not cleaned through the flight by crew - twice they were in a bit of state so I ended up cleaning the floor with tissues myself. Lovely. Shame to see one of the great carriers fall to such low levels."

Amenities practically non-existent and wrapped in cellophane, tube of toothpaste (if only the cap would open) could only fulfill brushing requirements for half a mouthful of teeth, no covers for the headphones. Totally inadequate for the money paid and shaming the word Premium Economy. Before I forget, the Boarding Service was confusing, calling colors Gold, Silver, Sapphire, etc. People just rushing the line and the staff losing their voice, screaming for order.

So no food until 1 hour before landing (11 hours later) unless I wanted to pay for chocolates with a credit card. I kindly asked for some water, got some orange juice too - didn't want to push it even though I saw a bottle of champagne open in the galley - not worth the risk of a bad reaction. I cannot recommend this cabin based on the high prices they charge. The staff mean well - however a gulf of enthusiasm exists between them an Singapore Airlines, Qatar, Cathay etc. It's not cultural, it's just indifference.

The seats are small and uncomfortable especially with the layout for the passenger sitting next to the window - you are basically trapped inside and you'd have to disturb the other passenger to get out. Furthermore, the ""bed"" does not extend fully so it uses creatively a makeshift ""fold down stool"" - if you apply too much pressure on that stool, it unlocks itself and seem to break off from the latch - it's just flimsy! The food is very low quality and tatstes bland - I have already tried the regular meal and special meals - don't bother.

They were basically (on both flights) rushing through the service and not to be seen for the next 8 hours before the breakfast service. On both flights, there was no water offered during the night, which is really a shame considered the price difference between economy and premium. The meals were overcooked, and on both flights the knives could not cut through the ""best of British Beef"". Given that the hot meals are the same than in Club (according to BA's marketing), I would have been furious if being offered this quality of food in Business Class. A perfect example of unprofessionalism of the crew was when I got up after dinner and went to the galley (as nobody cared to answer the bell) and asked for a Baileys: the young attendant looked at her coworker and asked her what a Baileys was, and the answer came ""sorry Sir, we don't have that kind of wine. Would you like some white?"" I am missing the good old BA and will take my business to some other reputable airlines in the future, even if it means paying a few hundreds more."

Security quick I'm a BA/Oneworld sapphire member so used the North lounge which was okay. Flight boarded on time but departed 15 min late and arrived 15 min late. A320, seat 11A an exit seat was fine however no service at all on board. Return check in quick as was security, the BA lounge in EDI has been the same for a few years now. It's at least quiet with nice staff and pleasant staff. Boarding through gate 20 on to a pretty old 767 departed 30 min late. Club Europe on domestic flights is a new introduction. Actually it replaced what was BA economy class. A cynical ploy by the BA board to extract more money out of its loyal customers? The aircraft was pretty full so some people like BA although I suspect many passengers were transferring at LHR. Service was okay food economy standard although included in the price. Arrival at T5 around 30 min late 10 min for bags. I fly between 20 & 30 times each year 90% on long haul flights. I have supported BA in the past although I've not used them long haul for about 17 months. Basically they are not good enough. Cut backs and poor service is evident. I expect security comfort and some service when paying £2500+ for a business class ticket. Qatar, Cathay and even SriLankan offer better service. On reflection I fly business class on most flights so I don't actually need any frequent flyer status. The cost of loyalty outweighs the benefits. I might fly BA in future as a very last resort or to use up the miles I've earned. But my loyalty will be my wallet in future. Bye BA."

The price of the ticket about £500 for a 2 hour flight - had no relationship to the ultra-economy service on this flight. The aircraft was very dirty - I wonder whether BA pays for fewer cleaners as other airlines don't seem to have filthy aircraft. In Business the seats are identical to economy so what are we actually paying for? There is no place to power devices and forget WiFi or overhead screens. In business the food was an awful English breakfast. No better than economy. The embarrassed flight attendants seemed to give all the business passengers champagne to take-away to try and make up for the no-frills service. It feels chronic under investment for years has left this a bare-bones airline milking short-term profits and forgetting that their business model should be more than just for 1 year.

Food was not edible, i tried the beef option but could not eat it. What i found truly shocking was the snack in morning of the return leg was nothing more than a muesli bar in premium economy. -Cost savings taken to ridiculous levels at BA. They have even managed to find a way to economise on the quality of the sleep mask supplied (no more cotton or other skin friendly material on the inside but awful full nylon / polyester material and only one instead of two straps on back).

The seats are a bit more comfortable and spacious than economy class, the entertainment viewing screen is ok as are the films music and earphones.

BA's business class seats, once the best in the industry, are almost the worst. The pods are 8 abreast in the upper deck and very narrow. This is an unpleasant aircraft, with 3 toilets to share between 64 passengers. In business Class I think that's a poor ratio. The flight attendants were initially reasonably friendly (though I noticed no acknowledgement for being a Gold Card holder), but their interest waned as the flight progressed. It took 2 hours to get a drink and almost 4 hours from take off before the main course was served. The beef was cold as were the vegetables. It was actually inedible. I suspect it had just been left out. After dinner we were half way through our 8 hour flight and I was never offered another drink. I gave my suit to be hung up and had to beg to reclaim it at the end of the flight. British Airways has gone from being one of the best to one of the worst airlines I have flown recently.

The catering was really poor and seemed to have been affected by cost cutting: lunch was a small portion of very tough beef, accompanied by a tiny salad which was still frozen; there was then nothing for nine hours (no snacks available anymore) until a second hot meal, of a small chicken curry, was served shortly before landing. A choice of drinks was offered only once, shortly after takeoff; during the entire remainder of the flight the crew came around again twice with water and juice, but nothing else was offered; the second meal came with a minuscule cup of water and nothing else (I asked for more water but the crew said they didn't have any). By the time we landed I was hungry and thirsty, and I would advise anyone using this flight to bring their own food and drink. The crew were invisible for most of the flight.

This is a monumental con. Also, imagine your worst school meal in a school cafeteria, and that is what you get in the BA lounge at ORD. The food was some kind of dreadful steamed slop that you literally would not feed your dog. I used to imagine that long haul business and first class passengers were valued by trans-Atlantic airlines. The British Airways business class product is the worst by far. Old aircraft, old seats, disillusioned crew, and simply the most terrible food imaginable. British Airways hold their premium class passengers in contempt.

On our flight to Tokyo Narita from London Heathrow we were advised by the Cabin Crew soon after take off that the catering supplies loaded were 'limited'. To cut a long story short, this meant that my partner, who was the last to be served, was told what was available rather than asked what he would like. This is in spite of there being only 5 passengers in the 8 seat cabin. For breakfast prior to landing, we were informed that only two cooked breakfasts were available so it would be first come first served. The presentation of the food that was available was poor & certainly not worthy of the fine dining description BA uses for its First Class catering. We spoke to the Cabin Services Manager who was extremely apologetic & confirmed that there has been cost cutting - apparently at the behest of the new CEO who comes from low cost sister airline Vueling, with a resultant increase in unhappiness & complaints from passengers. The famous First Class Tasting Menu we enjoyed on previous flights is now gone & other cost cutting around on board service is very evident - even the rose in the First Class toilet was dead which really epitomises the lacklustre airline that BA has become. I fly regularly long haul with KLM & their new Business Class offering is now far superior to BA's First. How can our national airline, with whom we should be proud to fly, compete with other superior European & Gulf carriers when the emphasis seems to be only on never ending cost cutting that now affects even the most premium passengers? The Cabin Services Manager entered a formal complaint on our behalf from on board on 3 May. Almost a month later, although immediately acknowledged, BA have not responded, probably due to more administrative cost cutting. I should add that the ground service at Heathrow T5 & the Concorde Room were very good but as regards on board service, BA offends their premium passengers like this at their peril."

Meal selection consisted of a chicken salad/prawn (which looked reasonably nice however I'm allergic to seafood) or a toasted cheese roll.

I have read many reviews recently of BA falling behind the competition so my expectations were low - but even these were beaten by this overall truly awful experience. Firstly I have to say the crew on the flight were super in every way. Nothing was too much trouble and they seemed to genuinely be enjoying their work. I should have given my 'BA Golden Ticket' to one of them but forgot. However no matter how good the crew, it cannot make up for everything else being totally awful and shabby. The seat was filthy with what looked like ketchup from the previous flight and crumbs everywhere. Not a nice start. The aircraft was very very old - a lot of the interior was patched up with white gum. The IFE didn't work properly. Amenity kit was a bag and the headsets poor quality. The toilets (compared to AA) were small unpleasant. Seat is not up to most Business class standard. Food was awful and the 'club kitchen' almost non-existent.

Boarding was on time. On board it was soon evident that the interior of the plane had seen better days with my wife's TV nearly falling off its mounting. Fortunately she was able to position it during the flight so that it stayed in place but it was quite precarious. Push back and departure was exactly on time. Within a short time the crew started the evening service and this is where it all seemed quite strange. Unlike the flight out, where there was a more relaxed atmosphere, the crew seemed to feel there was a need to rush whatever they were doing to the point that some of them were literally running down the aisles. The food was hurriedly delivered to us and was disappointingly under seasoned and pretty tasteless. I can only assume that the object of their haste was to get everyone fed and watered and bedded down as quickly as possible. To be quite honest I felt like we were being looked after by a nanny and told to go to bed early and I almost expected them to say 'I want you to go to sleep now and I don't want to here a sound out any of you until the morning'! Now I know that the crew are all entitled to their breaks etc, but at the end of the day (or night) they are working and are getting paid to do so. In my opinion if they just slowed down a little and had more time for the passengers, it would improve the flight considerably. Breakfast was OK although I seemed to be the only person trying the bacon rolls and after one mouthful I understood why. In a blind tasting I probably would have guessed I was eating rubber bands. We arrived on time and after quite a long walk to immigration and the baggage reclaim, our cases were waiting for us. Overall very disappointing and based on this flight I would not recommend BA."

Made time for a good rest. Configuration in club is not my favourite with reversed seats. Some crew choose to open the curtain every time the serve while other serve in front of you which will give you a better feeling of a private space Best thing about ba is that its cheap and you can have the Dorset crab for lunch at Fornum and Mason in terminal 5.

British Airways has been the airline our organisation has chosen for our staff for years when they fly the routes offered to our business destinations. Recently as the Director I have been getting complaints about service, cleanliness and comfort from several members of my staff, which I have listened to but have been too busy and really hadn't listened properly, exactly what BA seems to do based on my personal experience. This recent trip to Toronto summed everything up for me. Firstly, after paying around £1000 extra each for a Premium Economy seat for each of the three of us travelling, unlike competitors BA does not provide priority boarding, you line up with all the other economy passengers?. When on board you are met with smiling staff, some immaculately dressed, others who look as if they have had a bad night, so who manages quality and standards?. Premium economy offers a little more space than economy, however that is about it. Service levels in the cabin are minimum, food is unexceptional, and to be honest is a disgrace compared to the price, and towards the end of the flight you are offered a second drink and 'a biscuit' delivered with all the fanfare of a 'gold bar' being delivered, however the discontent and upset on my flight by passengers in Premium Economy was both palpable and vocal, and staff could not have cared less. Other companies such as Air Canada offer a superior experience for the same price. BA management need to get their act together otherwise many customers such as my organisation are just on the edge of abandoning them completely. Familiarity definitely breeds contempt, but BA really is taking the biscuit with this and some of its other products. The marketing image does not match the reality. BA Ground service and management at Toronto is appalling, staff sitting around, passengers bags missing, delayed, no one to help? staff being openly rude and dismissive.

Pleasant surprise - its pretty top notch. Good food and plenty of booze. Nice and airy with spacious seating. We wondered for a moment if we had wandered into the wrong lounge. All good so far. Then the flight was called and our new found love affair with BA quickly receded. The walk to the gate was miles, it took us 15 minutes - and needed a bit of a run as well. Arrived all nice and sweaty. Plane was busy and we had the front row (the best seats). Usual disappointment with the lousy seats - economy masquerading as business seats. Plane old and dirty. The WC was disgusting - dark and dingy and the ""bowl"" - well, I dare not even try and describe it here - save it looked like the previous person had not flushed it - leaving a permanent effect. Took off on time. My wife had the sandwiches - which she said was dry and tasteless. I settled for a couple of Gin and Tonics. You don't expect much nowadays from BA and therefore you are disappointed - before you get a chance to be disappointed. Crew were fine - and don't like the BA cost cuts.

The layout of the business class cabin is so bad with half the seats facing backwards that you have someone staring at you when the little divider is not up, the seats are extremely narrow that you cannot easily turn when they are in the sleep position and they are so low that it is almost impossible to get up from them. In more than 50 years of traveling, I have not been in a worse business class. The selection of films and music is limited and the screen small. The food on the two trips was passable but nothing more and the wines less than passable unless you like plonk. I do not suppose it is much fun for the flight attendants to work in such a low class environment but they did not one thing more than was absolutely necessary, I have saved the best for last because on the return flight the temperature of the cabin was close to freezing and I wore two pullovers and a blanket and was still cold.

The flight was quite full and there are a constant stream of people from the economy cabin coming through the business class cabin to use the toilets. This is really quite irritating especially during meal service. No attempt was made by the crew to stop this or even close the curtain splitting the cabins even after complaints. I find the aircraft consistently dirty and on this flight someone had left chewing gum on the seat as well. I think BA don't care, on the flight from Istanbul, electronic devices are banned, other airlines allow them up to boarding and then arrange for them to be taken off you. British Airways has not even bothered to offer entertainment, or even extra magazines on the flight. They really don't appear to give any care for their passengers even those flying business class."

The first class fight to was OK - nice cabin crew and good food, but grubby cabin and clear cost cutting - no snacks, water etc in the galley like there used to be. Absolutely no help on the return trip - despite requests before the flight - because I was walking with a stick. I'd requested an aisle seat, had to ask again at check in as they had given me a seat in the middle which would have really annoyed other passengers as I tried to get across them to go to the loo etc with my stick. Really poor value at $3,300 and rubbish seats, uncomfortable and tv screens that aren't great. The food was awful - clear that costs are being cut massively. Maybe their plan is to offer such rubbish food that when they introduce food you have to buy in long haul we all feel grateful! It's a pity really. It's obviously BAs call if they want to be a no-frills airline, but I'd rather they were honest with us so that we can choose amongst the many other no frills airlines. But they keep trying to say that BA is a leading brand with strong values when clearly they've decided to cut costs wherever they can but still charge high prices. Might make them profitable to be a follower in the short term but I suspect people will vote with there feet and fly with someone else."

The lounges at LHR T5 need work. Yes British Airways are investing but long overdue. The small lounge for B gates needs to be re-thought and offer better food options. To the aircraft - its been refitted apparently, but should be scrapped. The seats remain tired. The vanity screen was not working properly. The entertainment system is past its best, with smudges and scratches. The carpets look like they need a very good clean and are grubby indeed. The toilets are 'old'. Overall, the aircraft is well past what could be described as a premium. Regarding the crew - they have been bashed and are a shadow of their former selves. Sad but true. Too many apologies for the rubbish decisions of management. On this trip the galley kitchen was poorly stocked and many of the usual items were missing e.g. Waitrose fruit and yogurts. They have also stopped the ice-cream. Food served was not good - saving grace was the meat platter, but what could you do to spoil sliced meats and cheese. Blankets are faded and ragged. The toilet bags are a joke. Cheap and nasty. This route was the jewel in the airline crown and one that has slide down the priority ladder. BA need to invest in a new fleet. Re-energise the crew. Change the catering and get a few more choices. Upgrade the seating and change seating configuration to avoid being an Olympic pole vaulter."

The upstairs of the A380 was in need of a serious clean. Cabin crew friendly, although you can sense lower morale. BA flights are often late now in my experience. The Club World A380 seats aren't comfortable. Despite everyone knowing, crossing over someone's legs too get out is still a nuisance. There is a scrum it down for last use of toilets before landing - I had one bloke shout at me when I'd been waiting long before him and he'd just turned up and tried to arrogantly barge in.  Many long term loyal passengers are starting to feel disrespected and undervalued, let down after years of loyalty and serious spending. We're not getting what we're paying for, although charged.

This will definitely be my last time with British Airways, I have already changed my return ticket to Cathay Pacific. The business class experience with BA has suffered so much cost cutting they are well below every major competitor. Short flight to Heathrow and the afternoon snack was pitiful - probably worth about $3 at most. Seat legroom is awful, and not far off the 29 inch size that Economy is being cut to. Staff onboard were friendly, and that is all. Lounge at T5 was again very poor - crowded, food choice and standards like a cheap motorway café, dirty and nobody seemed to be cleaning. The toilet was disgusting. Evening departure to HKG and went back into the terminal to find something proper to eat. Onboard the BA club world product is lousy - cheap, low quality amenities, a very poor meal choice and standard, washrooms unstocked and quite dirty, the cabin worn and scruffy. As an expat living in Germany, I have remained loyal to BA until now, but this is the last time I will waste our company money using them. It is quite clear that BA are abusing their monopoly situation at Heathrow, cutting their own costs to boost shareholder returns without giving one thought to the longer term reputation (and profitability) of the airline. If you are undecided about choosing BA over another airline, quite simply do not consider BA - you will be very disappointed and feel cheated."

A fast priority security lane had me in the first lounge in 15 mins. Unfortunately first lounge was full (of gold card members) and so had to sit in the Biz lounge. Good menu to eat on the ground and decent selection of wine and beers. Fast boarding once it started and greeted at the door and taken to 2A. Excellent rose champagne served by friendly and professional crew. A weird but tasty starter of a cured / dried salmon followed by steak which was well cooked. Good cheeses and all courses selected were available. After some decent sleep, a fast breakfast served as late as possible ended a decent flight. T5 North lounge was packed with a 20 min wait for a shower which are now looking tatty and dirty. Decent breakfast selection of hot rolls, fruit, cereals etc. Quick board for the flight to Berlin. Ridiculous leg room -at 30 inches max. Very cramped. Don't like the table in the middle and several couples asked for them to be removed. An ok snack of cold meats though stingy portions. On time arrival and fast bags finished off a good and cramped outward leg. Returning to London in economy was possibly the worst short haul flight ever (including low cost airlines). A full A321 was cramped, insufficient bins (with one out of service) and the now infamous terrible leg room.(I understand this is to get even worse when BA moves to 180 pax on an A320 in line with charter and low cost carriers. Slow food and drink service with little take up. Some couldn't buy as no cash accepted. Not even juice, water and coffee offered for free. This penny pinching denying you even a glass of water makes the US and Canadian carriers look high class. The only saving grace were great crew who were embarrassed by the product they had to deliver. The whole plane looked fed up, subdued and just waiting for the hell to finish. Final leg to Toronto on a 777 included a bus mystery tour to a remote stand. Nice crew who were efficient and offered decent service. Poor lunch of roast chicken, weird mash and overcooked greens. Not Biz class food and pretty average. (more like economy food). Afternoon tea was fine, with a fast deplaning and bags. On the long haul legs, the IFE was identical to Christmas, poor choice, little new material - clearly even the IFE is now down graded. The biz class product - once cutting edge is in urgent need of a revamp if only to get rid of the 8 across and lack of privacy. How the mighty have fallen! Experiencing four classes on four legs, showed the gulf in all classes between BA and competitors on both short and long haul. The short haul legs to / from Berlin are worse than budget airlines where at least you know what you're getting and it's reflected in the fare and extras. With less leg room, fewer toilets, reduced quality and/or no refreshments, and a general downgrading of service, the only thing not reduced is the price. This suggests that the BA Exec and IAG only care about the bottom line and not the customer or reputation of a once world class airline. The only thing left to strip customers of is the Exec Club and Avios. It's only a matter of time before this final nail in the BA coffin hits the customer at which point - I'm off! Hello Star Alliance!"

Onward flight to St Lucia, paid for advanced seating allocation as did not want to travel facing the back of the aircraft. Tired, worn interior and the food reflected this too. Outbound crew were helpful and energetic, keen to assist where possible and were prompt to attend when the call button was used. Inbound flight was the same tired interior, unappealing menu and indifferent service. The only redeeming event was that my reading glasses and pen, left on board on the outbound flight were returned to me 5 days later when I travelled home. 10/10 to British Airways staff in St Lucia for managing this so well. I hope that BA will be renewing its fleet soon, it will not be my first choice of carrier for long haul travel until some investment has been made."

This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."

The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."

Flew Kuwait to Edinburgh via London. Aircraft are still comfortable, timekeeping is good, and information from the flight deck is always forthcoming. However, most of the cabin crew were ""mature"", and the food and drink offering is now minimal. Breakfast from Kuwait was eggs mixed with vegetables (no, not the omelette we used to have) plus mushrooms and potatoes both prepared as a mushy sort of tortilla: both looked like something you would spoon out of a tin for a baby. ""Lunch"" was a mars bar or similar. I did not bother with the ""buy on board"" stuff on the flight to Edinburgh - I get a better choice in the terminal when I get off the aircraft. The domestic flight back from Edinburgh to Heathrow had the most appallingly childish cabin crew I have ever seen on BA, giggling at each other during the safety demonstration - very unprofessional. The evening meal out of London back to Kuwait was more like a snack, with a smallish steak, three snap peas, three baby carrots (I counted the things), and another babyfood potato thing. ""Breakfast"" was a muesli bar. Sorry guys: a comment on this board that BA equals ""Budget Airline"" just about sums it all up. I have other choices from the Gulf back home, and next time I will be thinking about taking one of them: the only attraction with BA is the extra legroom in Premium Economy, the choice of entertainment, and the direct flight to Heathrow rather than having to fly down the Gulf and return. Otherwise, the epitaph ""how the mighty have fallen"" springs to mind."

I fly British Airways Club Europe only because the FAs are better, the lounge is a welcome benefit - and if you book far ahead enough - you can get a reasonable deal plus Avious points. That aside there is little benefits to flying say Ryanair. The trip started at T5 and the Northern lounge was not, for a change, to busy. Had a fruit and coffee breakfast. The options were a group of highly unhealthy looking bacon baps - dripping fat all over the place. Some years ago - BA provided some nice scrambled eggs. Now they don't. Flight left from the ""A"" terminal and we boarded ""downstairs"" from the lounge. The plane was half full. It was clean and valeted. We pushed back 10 minutes early. My wife had a sort of brunch thing, cheese and ham + rolls. She said it was ok. I had a couple of Gin and Tonics. The FA said she had never seen such an empty flight - and neither had I for that matter. The now chargeable food and beverages in Economy went down like a lead balloon apparently. I read the BA ""Brochure"" on the now chargeable food and as a Sales and Marketing professional - It was the most patronising piece of rubbish I'd ever read. It read as if BA were providing the most amazing product to the benefit of all. And goodness me - the products are not cheap - over a £1 for a kit kat. We landed ahead of time and has to walk the tarmac like Ryanair customers. Several years ago you had the air-bridge. Now you don't. The return flight started in the shared lounge which was rammed. This in part is due to Qatar airlines operating out of Pisa and their Business Class customers use the same facility. Some booze and snacks - nothing edible. Flight delayed by 30 minutes. Plane was rammed. Very pleasant FAs. Afternoon tea - with horrible dried out sandwiches + scones that didn't look like scones. On both flights - the usual three seats with the centre seat being a table. No legroom. Hopelessly inadequate product which can be as high as £600 return. Docked at the ""B"" terminal and had to walk miles to the trains - that took us back to T5/Terminal ""A"". All in all - another disappointing experience from the ""World's most frugal Airline""."

The flight to Hong Kong with British Airways showed up all that is bad about British Airways now and how far it has fallen behind other airlines. The continual penny pinching and poor staff attitude was evident throughout the flight. Check-in at Terminal 5 was chaotic, there having been a ""computer glitch"" which greatly slowed the check-in and bag drop processes. There were too few BA staff on hand to assist and those that were in evidence were being continually harassed. Business check-in was better but still very busy. BA needs to speed up bag drop urgently. Other airports allow you to print your own baggage labels and take your baggage straight to be loaded onto the conveyor belt where a member of staff checks the weight to make sure it is not too heavy, not perfect for all passengers but would considerably speed up the process for the vast majority of passengers who can check in easily. The lounge was a disappointment with tired dirty furniture, used dishes not being cleared, too few seats for the number of passengers and very poor food availability. Not a great place to rest before an 11 hour journey and I would concur with other comments about the deteriorating standards. Compare this to the other ""home"" lounges of other carriers such as those at Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur. Took a shower whilst waiting and that was OK. The flight was not good at all. Cabin crew showed general lack of interest throughout the flight and seemed interested in just getting the meals served and then disappearing from view for the rest of the flight until it was time for the meal service prior to landing. Gone are all the small (and not so small) touches that made flying with BA a pleasure, such as hanging up coats, hot towels, a second round of drinks, a nice meal at a leisurely pace and an overall feeling of being well looked after. A comment about the seats, how can BA justify 8 across in Business Class? When the ying/yang seats were first introduced they were a revolution, but a lot of other airlines now only have 6 across with a lot more space and comfort and in most cases you don't have to climb over another person to get out whilst they are sleeping. I had a window seat and I felt very hemmed in. There was no storage space for the things you need during a flight, glasses, tablet computer, water bottle etc. All were kept on the floor or crammed down the side of the seat. Sadly BA is no longer my airline of choice. I spent many years doing international business travel and when you saw the Union Flag on the tailfin at some distant airport you knew you were already nearly home. I saved a considerable number of Avios points for my retirement which I am now using up, but on other airlines within the One World Alliance where possible and who offer a far better product and actually look after their passengers and make them feel wanted. Sorry BA but you've lost my loyalty. Club World is now very poor (and also Club Europe now) and you've lost the plot to the bean counters. Never thought I'd say this but I've joined the ABBA club, anybody but BA."

Full, with limited seating, a forty minute wait for food, no available snacks and empty drinks cabinets. I left as hungry and thirsty as I arrived. No to worry though, British Airways will feed me onboard. Once onboard, for a two hour flight, I was served afternoon tea which consisted of three finger sandwiches, a scone and a really small slice of cake. This meal was completely insufficient. There was one drinks round offered and one top up offered. Given that BA use the smallest glasses possible, coupled with its love of miniature cans of lemonade, you will be thirsty. I found trading up to business class to be completely not worth the extra spend. After being disappointed by the outbound catering my disappointment was set to continue with the exact same afternoon tea meal served on my inbound flight.

This meant it was overcrowded and dirty (through no fault of the regular staff. They just could not keep up with the number of passengers). We could not get a seat anywhere and when we advised BA staff of this we were told to come back later and see if there were any seats free. The BA ground staff were completely overwhelmed by the number of business class passengers complaining and appeared at their wits end. The flight was mediocre to say the least. The food was average and the service satisfactory. Having paid £2000 for a ticket it is not unreasonable to expect a good service. We formally complained to British Airways via their customer services department and the response came back as they were moving to the south terminal and we needed to be understanding as things would get better in the future! We were not even offered a refund on the tea we bought in the main area of the terminal as we could not get into the lounge they had provided.

When the food was served we had been noted as 'not eating' - when the mistake was realised and the mistake initially made by the senior stewardess, the two hot options were unavailable - I had cheese and biscuits and my husband went without. The quality of the video/audio was very poor - the picture clarity poor and the sound distorted making certain films unwatchable. On the return flight the Executive Lounge was fully booked and we had to use the packed lounge in the main terminal.

Despite paying a premium price you can only book your seat within 24 hours of departure unless you pay a £40 - £50 surcharge. Reluctant to pay we had some anxious moments worrying whether we would sit together. In the end it was OK but we can't get over the cheek of charging to book a seat - Emirates and Etihad don't charge. The seats themselves were very old and uncomfortable. Leg room was OK but the seats were very narrow. Nothing like the comfort of Emirates or Etihad in Economy. Inflight entertainment was on a post card size screen with a touch screen that was very inconsistent. Picture quality was like watching a TV in the 1950's. Food was appalling. Little choice, insipid starters and mains swimming in water. Other than an initial drinks run and obviously the food service the rest of cabin service was nil! If you want extra drinks or service including water the only recourse was to visit the galley at the back of the plane. Cabin crew were surly and generally unhelpful.

I returned my main course of fillet steak because it was vastly overcooked and the potato/cheese thing uncooked. The 'chef' told me all meals arrived in packs and were just heated up. He could not alter the cooking time for the steak. I had a very ordinary salmon fillet instead. The sweet was just two slices of Madeira cake with a spoon of jam and a spoon of something white. The breakfast muesli was horrible and the French toast was inedible. The wine didn't seem to be what was described and the orange juice seemed out of a carton. The First Class lounge experience was very business class at the most. Will not travel BA first again. Felt very rushed in the morning with staff desperate to serve breakfast not giving chance for people to wake up and get dressed."

Poor third party lounge with little food choice, disappointing wines and little ambience. Boeing 787-800 aircraft was substituted by Boeing 787-900 which was good on the face of it, except the same seat number moved me from the last row of biz to the one in front of the toilets - annoying as gate staff unable to move me. With the air bridge withdrawn, the plane went tech due to a power issue. Two hours later after a total reboot of the aircraft systems we took off. Excellent updates from captain. However, cabin crew were absent during the delay with Biz passengers including me having to ask for a glass of water. Bizarrely First was blocked off with lights off and vigorously enforced with no access to the front bathroom. Drinks and dinner served promptly. My choice of fruit for breakfast had already run out. Only 4 loaded for the whole of biz with honey and yogurt offered which turned out to be a 99 cent pot plonked on a plate. No croissant offered (left in oven in error) and the orange juice has been downgraded to UHT out of a carton. On the return leg from Heathrow T5, the club lounge was very disappointing. Shabby condition, poor food and drink service by the third party provider, with dirty / scruffy toilets which I had to queue for. Worst lounge experience to date and cannot be called first class by any means. Prompt boarding on a 777-200 with the first entrance blocked off. The cabin manager was by herself and so we were pointed towards first class.  Friendly crew, prompt champagne and a prompt drinks service after take off. recovered things a tad. IFE had not changed since my flights in October which was disappointing. The amenities bag in first is now the old club world offering. Average menu with the usual suspects of Beef, Chicken and Cod but were cooked and presented really well. The promised cheese plate had already run out - only 4 loaded. (seeing a theme here) and so cheese was fetched from club. Afternoon tea sandwiches were dry and bland. In the race to the bottom, BA continue to cut service - especially on the food front. I don't find it acceptable in first class for something as simple as cheese to run out with club food being substituted. This may save money (and wasted food) but the crew whilst cheerfully making the best of a bad job are not being given the food or or product to deliver first class service. In fact, the crew were the only saving grace. BA don't seem to get it. Even in premium cabins, they continue to downgrade service to save money and gain an even worse reputation as the UK's flag carrier. Biz and First Class products are dropping at an alarming rate. Wake up BA and IAG - before it's too late."

It is certainly showing signs of wear with tacky material hanging down around some of the seats. The seat cushions need refilling. The general ambiance is quite good. A refurbishment is long overdue. The food quality and choice is generally quite poor - although the Crab Tortellini was good. Nobody invited us to choose from the menu or to offer drinks. I had to walk the floor and find someone. All sloppy. The menus also were worn and scruffy and someone, a child I think, had scribbled on the inside, some funny cartoons. We boarded and the flight departed to the minute. All good. The Boeing 787 has a small 1st Class and I realized that the space also is smaller than the 777 option. The 747 alternative is a total disaster and I go to great lengths to avoiding flying their 747s. Food was OK. Very little wow factor. The meze was fine. They ran out of Cod - and at this point I don't think we had hit the cruise. Seven from eight passenger - and only one Cod apparently. I had the lamb which was alright but on short night flights I prefer not to have meat. My wife's allocated seat was - broken, hence the vacant seat on the flight. So she sat one side of the plane and I sat the other. Brilliant. The plane was only six months old. Given the competition on this route you would think BA would want to impress. Was it a coincidence I wonder that there was no Arabic or Asian passengers on the flight? With Emirates on this route - why would there be? We landed on time and then had to walk miles. Another underwhelming experience with BA. I wonder what those who spent £3,000.00 one way thought."

Our outbound flight had certainly not been memorable, but new to British Airways we were prepared to wait and see. The inbound flight commented upon here was much worse, but with many facets of the earlier experience.  We paid two supplements for the flights. A substantial fee to upgrade from Economy and a very unpopular one to ensure as elderly clients - on overnight flights - we could sit together! The combined cost therefore was significant. The benefits were not. Firstly, upon being seated we were faced with a cabin crew apparently in a bad mood. A lady ahead of us had a headrest problem, she was rudely dealt with and seemed intimidated.  Throughout the flight during waking hours, passengers seemed to be a nuisance. Food - as we had flown this class on other scheduled airlines, we were expecting a menu to select meals. How silly. Here the economy trolley brought appalling food with a twin choice - chicken or veg (a bright green Risotto). So, no Choice! No bread roll, no cheese and bikkies, a 'choice' of one red wine, and plastic cutlery. This was served after the attention in Economy, and may account for the absence of choice. Whatever, it was awful. It was noticeable how many meals remained uneaten. What a waste of resources. Significantly better quality has been had on holiday airline journeys of shorter duration. The Premium Economy (WTPlus) cabin had no provision for toilets. It was necessary to go forward to Club, or back to Economy! It became clear early-on that going forward was not popular with those in that cabin, so back it was! During the night, with passenger debris in aisles, this was hazardous with shiny plastic bags (from headphone containers) to slip on. Is nobody in British Airways capable of seeing the provision of a loo for 24 passengers is essential?  On arrival in UK we read that BA is to put even more seats in Economy class on this type of aircraft. Goodbye British Airways - not even nice to have used you."

After my arrival in Heathrow T5 the check-in area for Club Europe was clearly marked and separated for the rest of the check-in lounge and a host was guiding you to the check-in line. After saying hello to the host making my way to the check-in line I was stop with an unpleasant “Excuse me, this is business class”. Like a naughty school boy I returned to the lady and show her my boarding pass which allowed me to access the “exclusive area”. Check-in was smooth and I was airside in under 20 minutes. Enough time for some duty-free shopping in an airport already decorated for Christmas. Being a little bit hungry I was looking for the “light meals or snacks especially prepared for you” and “drink from our World Wine bar” as BA promised again on their website. The only  I made was some sad sandwiches and after checking 4 empty bottles on display I found some warm French white wine. Therefore, I decided to cut my time spent in the “comfortable private lounge” and treat myself with some Costa coffee and some nice tasty sushi in the terminal. Waiting for the promised menu which “features irresistible meal options crafted to perfectly match the time and duration of your flight”. Couple months ago a tasty plate with canapés was offered to passengers in Club Europe. In the London-Bucharest flight I was offered the eternal option “beef or fish” with, indeed, a nice polite smile from the Purser. The tray looked like an Economy tray on a Tarom or KLM flight to Bucharest. No salad, an overlapping end-of meal option of cheese and lemon merengue and a fish which was the blandest food I ever had onboard. When I was still looking for my “very British experience” the tray was taken away. Coffee and a second round of drinks were served shortly after the main meal service was finished. I couldn’t stop wondering where that smooth, stylish service from my last flight went. Of course, the crew was polite and nice as much as they can, shaping their enthusiasm according the product offered to passengers. And another odd element: no other drink service; you needed to ask for another drink as the crew was busy to stop the Club Europe toilet in the front from leaking and flooding the entire front galley."

What a mistake! On arrival to Heathrow's Terminal 5 I tried to enter the queue at zone B as directed by one of the information signs. I was told that the staff had decided to close that so I had to go somewhere else. I joined the queue at ""C"" instead but was told when I got to the front that business class checked in at H. I made my way to British Airways business class lounge, which was crowded, dirty with wet smelly bathrooms that looked more like a run-down bus station than an airline's lounge. The place was wildly understaffed which meant that there were used plates, cutlery and half eaten food littering tables in the room. It was far less crowed in the rest of the terminal which is where I waited for my flight. The gate was announced and I made my way to gate 10C where the flight was being bussed. I was in seat 3D. It was not a business class seat at all but an economy seat with almost zero legroom. The whole point of spending £385 was legroom and I didn't have any. I asked the flight attendant if anything could be done.  BA would not have been my choice anyway but I do understand that given tight schedules and limited choice sometime you are forced to fly with a particular company against your better judgment. In that case don't make the same mistake as me. British Airways."

The food was bordering inedible with especially the steak cooked beyond all recognition. As always BA's lack of dine on demand and inflight snacks were showing (the Club kitchen is getting worse each flight it seems). However the meal service is reasonably quick at just over 2 hours from take off and a significant improvement on the outbound flight. The inflight entertainment selection is quite good but the screen are small and terrible and the cabin as a whole could benefit from a total over hall. Pre-landing snacks were better than the main service but still not worth writing about. Crew were friendly through out the flight but again not very attentive by missing out drinks servings. If I had not managed to get the tickets at a heavily discounted price I would have felt cheated on both the hard and soft product provided.

We got served a small breakfast at departure (9am Tokyo time) and nothing until 90 minutes before landing. Pretty much 10 hours with no food!  So not only the food available seems to have been reduced but it is also very poorly timed.  It looks like despite BA's good profits, they are cost cutting to extreme levels. Perhaps the CEO could try out this sector in World Traveller or World Traveller Plus (rather the the First class he probably uses on a long haul flight) and see how he feels at the end of it!

Food not at all up to standard and can honestly say have had a better experience having flown business with Gulf and Asian carriers.

Return flight was equally poor. Rang the bell and no one came. Rang again after an hour to order breakfast. Stewardess came and said ""of course but we start serving from the other side"".

Very disappointed in all of it. Our flight was terribly delayed because the incoming flight to Gatwick was struck by lightening which is not BA's fault I know but I would have thought they could provide another plane to save having to wait so long as they have done in the past. Maybe they just don't have spare planes any more long haul.

The food is a disgrace, wines (white warm), reds (cold) so bad as when I asked for the Business class menu to compare it with First, was superior in every way. Example being First - Soup versus Business Crab Tian? The CSD just apologised and said I know its a disgrace but we keep telling them. Aircraft was so old the ceiling fell in with the celoptape loosing its grip and some foam plate hung out. It really is past a laugh asking people to pay their rates. Overall I find BA moving to a 3 star, its overall product is lazy, apathetic, inconsistent and tired. The crew are fantastic in the air as for the ground well its like a tube station or a civil servant job for life atitude.

OK boarding with juice and water offered on boarding. Bizarrely, no sparkling wine offered (""Sir - we only offer sparkling wine on flights from London"") No hot towel after take off but menu card offered. One round of drinks followed by dinner. Steak was overcooked, dry and with a greasy gravy - the worst meal to date. The biggest insult was the breakfast which has been downgraded from the ""muffin or nothing"" to a basket of smaller muffins, chocolate and cereal bars plus tea / coffee and juice. Just when you thought BA couldn't stoop any lower, they manage to find something else to nickel and dime. Good club lounge in T3 with decent showers. The flight from London to Lisbon was one of the best short haul flights for me. A younger mixed fleet crew were really friendly, offered great service and a prompt drink and snack service - a tasty roll (2 bites) and a desert (1 bite) with second drinks provided on request. Returning from Lisbon, a dreadful bus transfer to the aircraft, a more sullen and older crew with average service with the mini savory roll replaced by sweet or savory snacks (shameful that BA are increasing the sugar on offer across most flights with the current diabetes debate). The BA lounge on the B gates at T5 remains my favourite lounge with plenty of space and some peace and quiet. Onboard one of the old 747's with the old configuration with PE in front of biz class with juice, water or sparkling wine offered on boarding. My IFE had frozen before I sat down and even after reset had a mind of it's own. The safety video was abandoned soon after starting for a manual demo as there were clearly IFE issues across this aging 747. I finally gave up watching TV as the channel kept changing. No hot towels again. One drinks round and on asking for the little bag of pretzels, I was told they had be cut by embarrassed crew (at around 10p a bag - really?) A vile coleslaw starter, a choice of steak or butter chicken curry which I had and a small pot of chocolate pudding completed dinner. The chicken was tasty but not a business class entree (as claimed) by any stretch of the imagination. Tea and coffee but no after dinner drinks (had already been cut). The biggest insult in this continuing degradation of service is the scrapping of the second meal. The sandwich has gone with either 1 cookie or single finger of chocolate with tea / coffee with clearly embarrassed crew (again). This constant reduction in the PE product with the small stuff can't go much lower - there's only the seats and space left! Ironically, whilst in Lisbon the announcement was made regarding short haul food and drink being charged for in economy. BA are being disingenuous to suggest that people are asking for improved catering - yes, they're asking because you've cut the service back so much in the first place. I'd pay for a decent M&S sandwich but I enjoy my free drink. Charging for tea / coffee and juice - even Air Canada haven't stooped that low. I really worry for BA's future. The drive to improve the bottom line has gone too far. I don't see fares being reduced to reflect the reduced service. The board of BA / IAG group and their shareholders should be ashamed and embarrassed with themselves as the demise of the UK's flag carrier continues."

Unlike most of the Middle Eastern airlines we were just pointed in the general direction of our seats rather than shown to them. Aircraft was an older 777-200 in a 3 cabin configuration and the age was showing and while generally clean the trimming was coming apart, the IFE screens were small and the seats felt a bit cramped. Very much like Virgin Atlantic's Upper Class seat, these were great for sitting normally or fully flat but everything in between was a struggle. And the ying-yang seat configuration is akward to say the least but the centre seats are great if you travel as a couple. Welcome drinks were eventually served and we took off only slightly delayed. Dinner was painfully slow and it was a good 3 hours after take off before dinner was finished. Starter and dessert were ok, but the entree was far too overcooked for my taste. Also there is no dine on demand facility, you eat what you are given when it suits the crew. The crew were friendly but painfully slow. It also took more than an hour after dinner before the cabin lights were fully dimmed. Breakfast was served 2 hours before landing and the crew were transformed. It was a quick and efficient service, a shame it took them 9 hours to get to that point. Breakfast was not great but edible. We landed at Bangkok on time but no fast track cards for immigration were given. Bags arrived on the belt only minutes after we had passed through immigration. It is clear that BA have been cutting costs in their premium cabin and it shows in spades when compared to the Middle Eastern 3, the Asian airlines and even the US airlines. They could benefit from cutting the very generous bagage allowance and use the money saved on fuel on getting a new hard product (seats and cabins) and improving their soft product (food, service, etc), especially given their current price point.

We had to pass security and immigration one more time, we finally made it but we were the very last ones to board the plane to Geneva as it was about to close is door. I was shocked that British Airways did not provide us with any assistance, obviously they do not care about their customers. On our way back, the flight from Geneva to London was late by more than 40 minutes, and we had to run again in order to catch our flight to Atlanta.

The food is non existent, one ounce of salad and four once of a ""so-called"" meal + dessert and watery coffee. You will be left hungry, so don't rely on their food because it is more than a huge disappointment. We paid $3800 for this trip and I regret choosing this airline. Premium economy is not worth the extra fee, you only get 7 inches more than in economy but that's it. You will struggle to find a bathroom available and the food is exactly the same than in economy. That's it.  I will not fly with them again and for everyone who is interested to make a flight connection in London Heathrow, please make other arrangements as it is a huge airport and British Airways flights are late.

I would like to know who at British Airways sanctions the use of these tiny seats in Club (I know its nice to have the middle seat blocked but I would prefer a bigger seat to sit in - maybe BA should have a look at Turkish Airlines Biz cabin!) The service outbound was just adequate - one drinks round, then a dinner service (BA872) which was edible but slopping / dumping the meal out of a heated plastic container into a china dish in front of the passenger lacks some grace to say the least. Are the crew trained to do this or was it just bone idleness not to prepare the meal in the galley then serve to the passenger? In all, the outbound journey was just about passable but not comfortable given the seating. Now for the return - what a joke! Nn lounge at Krakow - that's right you squeeze onto the end of that overcrowed bench by the gate and keep quiet! The flight was delayed by nearly 3 hours, so by the time boarding started it was a scrum (priority boarding abandoned) to get through the gate as most passengers were so fed up. British Airways prefer not to pay for airbridge access to the plane so we were then treated to a nice ride in an old banger bus crammed to the gills with sweaty fed up passengers all trying to avoid other peoples armpits. Once on the plane the same tiny seats, although we were winners all round as we managed to bag 1A and 1C so at least we had some leg room. The meal service on this leg really did make me giggle. The steward offered a shriveled chicken salad (leg meat skewers), or get this, a boxed sandwich. I actually had to ask if that was it? He replied ""yes"" to which I replied ""so who's eaten all the food?"" He laughed and actually said we were lucky, and if I had any food with me could he have some! And I'm not making this up. Once at LHR it took 1h for the bags to turn up by which time the Pod service to the parking had stopped (and that turned into a complete drama but I won't go there on this ocassion). So - what did we get for our Club fare to Krakow? In my opinion very little, and what we did get was rubbish. If anyone is thinking of going to Krakow with BA my advice is save your money and fly economy (with another airline), and spend the saving having fun there. In fact choose another airline since BA on this route are just a joke. I have been Club Europe hundreds of times over the last 20 years and the gradual decline in the product has now just about reached the point where once I have used up my 300K Avios it'll be Bye Bye BA for good.

Though I had purchased a business upgrade to avoid some of the horrible service I had received on my outbound flight and despite having only two carry on items and despite management's false statements in their replies to my earlier complaints that ""Our hand baggage allowance at two bags with a 23kg limit for the is also one of the most generous"", despite the fact that the flight was not full and more than half of the bin space in business class was empty, I was forced to check my bag carry-on compliant bag. The flight attendants were rather shocked about this and later apologized for the gate agent's unwarranted behavior. The flight was okay with the same uncomfortable coach seats in business class and an inedible food offering. In all a waste of money for BA's ""vaulted"" business class ""experience."" The recent Economist article about BA's race to the bottom service tier and the reneged promises made along the way speaks volumes about management's hostility towards customers and especially BA and OW elites. The asterisk on the Oneworld baggage page singles out BA as the only carrier in the group who will not allow it's own elite fliers and those on OW to have a checked bag on the lowest and only competitive fare BA offers. As the Economist article stated, loyalty is very easy to lose but extremely difficult to re-attain."

I enjoyed the food on the plane but my sisters friend who flew with us is a pescetarian which means she only eats fish and not meat, so the crew said that's no problem and gave her a disgusting baguette with tomato, but she didn't like it and there was no other choice for her. Complete waste of money but I loved the chocolate cake - the best I've had. To conclude the BA club Europe is a waste of money because the seats are exactly the same as economy class and your paying to travel in more comfort and luxury. The Club Europe seats are a joke."

Over the years British Airways first has gone so far downhill I'm afraid it just can't compete anymore, it needn't be so as the issues as I see them are all resolvable. However, the return leg was like flying with Ryanair. There were only 13 people in the cabin. There were no slippers, 2 of the menu items I requested were, in the words of the crew ""invisible"", and what did arrive was verging on inedible due to sauce being lumpy and near to warm. The chocolate lava cake contained no lava and quite how one can burn and cool food at the same time is beyond me. My father waited the entire flight, having asked on 3 seperate occasions, for a headset convertor. We were not asked if we wanted to be woken for breakfast, which I then missed assuming I would be woken. There was a palpable tension between the crew, which was confirmed on leaving the flight when we overheard a member of the crew comment he was happier to get away from the crew than the passengers. Once we had disembarked the aircraft, it was a further 25 minutes before we could get in to the airport as a door had not been unlocked. Finally, we collect our suitcases, which I have to say were present when we arrived at baggage reclaim, only to find 2 of the 4 had broken wheels. BA have subsequently supplied 2 new replacement suitcases. When comparing the service / food to Virgin UC for USA and Etihad First for east bound, BA just doesn't cut the mustard any longer I'm afraid. Such as shame as the seats / bed are great, but why pay the extra £ for service and food that just isn't forthcoming or varies from flight to flight?"

No entertainment apart from BA in flight Magazine and inflight shopping magazine. What really lets British Airways down, though is the food and beverage service. One (albeit fresh) sandwich and a drink. No tea or coffee service and the crew fast became invisible after the meal had been served. The flight was crowded too, meaning that overhead luggage space was at a premium as the negative effects of a generous hand luggage policy came into play.

Cabin crew clearly felt their only responsibility was to feed us. They disappeared after lunch for many hours - until it was time for tea.

No better than economy with centre seat empty. No drink offered on boarding. Economy passagers access past club section via a very narrow aisle most carrying or dragging oversized cabin baggage. Late take off due to mix up over economy seat allocations, and late arrival of passengers needing wheelchair assistance. Seat very uncomfortable. Little legroom and too much recline available to seat in front. The only saving point was the cabin manager whose hardwork and helpfulness was not matched by her workshy crew.

The plane left 25 minutes late - but with a couple of gin and tonics on the way I could not care less. Seats, the usual cramped 3 into 2 configuration that is unique to BA regional business class. A lousy set up. FA's were very friendly and provided great customer service. I complained about the high numbers of economy passengers hijacking the Club Europe WCs. I am not a snob by any means - but given I paid about £450 - one way for the ticket, surely ease of use for the loo is not unreasonable. FAs were sympathetic and I filled out a complaint card.

The flight departed at 7.55 pm but sat on the tarmac for 30 mins due to bad weather at London. Nonetheless, we only got in 15 minutes late. What went wrong from the very beginning was the check in process. We had showed up early but was refused check in at Club Europe. The ground attendant at Athens was incredibly rude and abrupt. If they had explained it to us nicely, we would have been fine with it. The result of the two hour before flight check in resulted in chaos and long lines given the fact that it was a 767 – a larger than usual plane. When we finally lined up, it took a good 30 minutes and more to check in at Club Europe because for half that time, there was only one counter open. Eventually, a second counter opened but a young couple jumped the queue by using the excuse that she was pregnant (unheard of policy and she was perfectly healthy given how fast she rushed up) and that was allowed by the ground atttendants despite the long line-up. Eventually we got to the plane only to find a ridiculous two tier Business class system that stretched into the economy section without any separation of any kind. Seating became problematic as those assigned to the windows on each side had smaller spaces, and in fact were no more bigger than the economy class. The middle seats were fine as passengers there had the empty middle seat. British Airways were passing off economy seats as business but though the service was different – you couldn’t properly enjoy it. We were placed on the last row of Business class (14) and these were three seats stretching into the economy class cabin. It was so confusing that the crew tried to serve economy class food to our end. To be fair, I think other business class passengers had it more unfortunate in their seat assignments. Furthermore, when asked for a blanket, I was refused one on the basis there was none until I walked into the upper cabin and found that business class passengers there had blankets. How is this fair? What principle of seat assignment did they use? The last few BA trips to Europe have been nightmarish, from boarding processes (this one in Athens was chaotic and unsystematic, they had allowed everyone to rush forward thus blocking the pre-boarding process). We were assigned different seats far from each other and not according to our preferences in our Exec Club, the online check-in keeps breaking down and when we tell BA that, they tell us to call in (laugh out hysterically here). In fact the more frequent you are a flyer (but not high profile), the worse treatment you get. I also get a sense that communication between the crew is poor given that different services were offered (later on, the Cabin director told me she could find a blanket for me but we were already 30 mins from landing). I cannot blame the crew, they work with what they get.  If we knew we were going to be treated no better than economy, we would have booked economy."

Seat pitch, entertainment unit, overall comfort was good. The food was ok but I think attention to detail is lacking to polish off this product. 1st meal you receive has metal cutlery yet the second meal is plastic. Only a minor negative.

Incredibly, British Airways serve such mean meals in business class on a transatlantic route, where they make most of their money, I was hungry after the meal so later on decided to 'raid the larder' but they only had sweet, which I generally avoid. The menu states there would be yoghurt and other stuff there they were not available. The FAs were embarrassed and got me some cheese.

The pop up screen from the armrest would not stay in one position, the screen was cloudy and scratched making it impossible to watch the inflight entertainment so after an hour was put away. 12 hrs with no entertainment is a very long time.

Cabin crew efficient but hardly any warmer than the food, they seemed to want to get the meal out of the way as quickly as possible.

My business colleagues before me passed through the gate without problem, however I was told to wait a moment as there was an issue with my boarding card - ""just a moment sir, oh it looks like you've been approved for an upgrade to First which is on the lower deck - no, sorry, my mistake - you're still in Business upstairs but I'm afraid we've had to move you from your selected seat"" (the one I'd paid the not inconsiderable sum of £80 to reserve in advance by the way) - but not to worry, it's still a window seat"". Except it wasn't - it was seat 50A, a windowless seat next to the toilets. The journey itself was uneventful. The food a bit of a disappointment without any flavour, my beef main was dry and rather tasteless. The wine was very good. Entertainment system not bad, though not a patch on the likes of Emirates. The staff friendly and efficient enough and I managed to sleep a few hours. I wrote to BA to complain about my change of seat and the unprofessionalism of telling someone they had an upgrade when they hadn’t. I had to chase up twice for a reply. The one I eventually got was pitiful and as impersonal as could be with a stock answer about the need for them to occasionally change people’s seats for operational needs The biggest issue for me with BA’s Club World however is its ridiculous layout whereby people have to step over each other’s legs - I don’t know of any other business class product which has this and it leaves BA well behind the competition. Although not my favourite airline, BA could do worse than take a note of their partners Iberia which has a staggered layout but offers direct aisle access to all. The situation whereby you find yourself starring at strangers until one of you decides to raise the privacy screen is also far from ideal and surely not safe as the cabin crew have to constantly lower it to pass hot food and drinks over your neighbour. Can’t help but think that BA have missed a real opportunity to shake things up with their new fleet of A380s. Whilst some airlines have been creative and had on-board bars, lounges and showers, BA has just packed in as many seats as possible – there are 7 abreast in Club World upstairs and 8 Downstairs which is staggering and an insult when paying premium prices. I should have known better having flown on one of BA’s other new additions to its fleet last year, a Boeing 787 to Toronto, which also was extremely claustrophobic. I returned home from South Africa upstairs on a Boeing 747 from Cape Town to London. The plane might have been older but the experience altogether more pleasant. This journey ironically took me up to Silver Membership, I won't be choosing to fly long-haul with BA again however, unless I have to. There are far better alternatives out there."

Finally, BA Customer Relations (based in India) responded to the 3+ hours delay by declining my claim with an insincere form letter. They also don't appear to have a good grasp of English. Overall, the end-to-end experience with BA was poor, and evidently they don't care. It is far, far, short of a First Class experience.

My seat was 2K, the senior male purser presented himself and addressed me with my Christian name - I did not object, had the impression that this is part of a nice intimate atmosphere. During the flight I found out that the majority of the 14 pax in First class preferred a more formal approach and were addressed with their family names. The purser offered the champagne welcome drink and I gladly accepted, and soon my face turned pale : the champagne was almost as warm as a cup of tea. His apology came prompt, but too late. They simply had no cool drinks on board and needed about an hour - or 30 minutes after takeoff - to have the respective drinks at the right temperature level. British Airways did not control this service process properly. Maybe nobody was in charge, maybe it was simply forgotten. The plane had arrived in Hong Kong about 5 hours earlier, so there was enough time to take care of the quality of beverages. The remaining flight was ok - cordial hosts in the predominantly male service team, food not sensational, but it was after midnight, so no complaints in this respect. Seat was fine, had a nice sleep during the 12.5 hour flight, breakfast options okay, arrival ahead of schedule. So is there a reason to complain and to give rather low marks? Yes, we are talking about first class in a leading European airline. The product has to be perfect, that's part of the game in first. Serious irregularities result in harsh reaction of the customer. For me this means that it was most probably my last long distance flight on BA. No marks on inflight entertainment because I chose the sleep option."

I would advise you to eat at the airport and not rely on the inflight slop.  You'll have someone climbing over you (or you'll have to climb over other people) to get to the toilet (this is business class!).  And then they'll lose your bag, tell you it's going to take 4-5 days to get it to you and provide no information about what to do in the meantime. If you try and call to get answers, leave at least 45 minutes time to sit in a queue (and then expect to be put through to the wrong person, despite selecting the correct option in the automated menu!).

Outbound menu did not correspond with the food on offer and the choice of meal soon became no choice at all as halfway through serving the cabin section of 32 seats they ran out. At least on the return flight they managed two thirds of the cabin section before the options dried up again. There was a number of very disgruntled passengers who wondered what exactly they paid extra for. A minor gripe was the toilet was right through the economy section which I'm sure got on those passengers nerves. Seats were ok but the quality of the media system was poor and the touch screen was unreliable and a number of them didn't work at all so more upset passengers. I gave up on mine and watched movies on my phone, the quality was far superior. I had heard good things about BA however that was flying business/club or first class.

The BA lounge in Phoenix is disgusting. We could handle it only for about 5 minutes. From the staff, the seats, the space, the food, nothing was orderly, clean, and it all seemed run-down. Walking around the airport aimlessly was a much better option. The boarding process was a joke. Again, the staff seemed confused, clueless, they called for everyone (all statuses, memberships, traveling with children, etc...all at once. It seemed nearly half of the plane was lined up to get in during premier boarding. There were 3 cabin staff for first class, two out of the three were not at all cordial. No greeting, they seemed to be running around the entire time even when the first class cabin was not full. They were not well groomed or spoke politely - came across unprofessional. This ruined the experience of flying first class. The meal experience was horrible. I ordered an appetizer, salad, and an main course. My husband ordered the 2 appetizers, and a main course. They came back to tell us they were out of one of the appetizers he ordered. First time this has ever happened in first class! They brought my appetizer, which we had to share, and they completely forgot about my salad. They brought the main (chicken dish), which was cold and dry. I had to send it back and changed to a steak. The steak came after about 20 minutes. Roughly 1/4 of the steak was hot, the remainder was cold (not even warm). The taste was amazing but ruined the dining experience completely. Upon waking up I opted to not have breakfast but have biscuits. The menu had ""assortment of biscuits"" and a few other bistro type items. When I ordered coffee and biscuits, the flight attendant looked concerned and said ""let me see if I can find some biscuits for you"". She came back with a bag of popcorn, a browny, and a few vanilla wafers. Typical items served on a domestic US based airline. My husband ordered coffee as well and asked for half and half. She failed to understand half and half and finally said ""oh you mean half and half in British accent. How is it possible to be a flight attendant and you cannot understand an American accent for half and half. Normally this would not even be an issue but having experienced all of the above this just seemed like the icing on the cake. Toilets were small, cramped, and dirty with no typical First Class amenities available within the toilets.

Onboard with comfortable fully reclining seats, duvet and amenities appropriately dispersed per sex. Staff friendly and accommodating, cabin (upper deck- A380) clean and comfortable. My next trip in August was last minute with just First available. I felt very comfortable booking this since my experience in business has always been very nice. My past experiences with First prior to renovated cabins, separate seating cells- I felt it was still going to be a lovely, comfortable experience, with enjoyable food. So, with all the changes in First now, I thought I would really be in for a relaxing treat. I want to preface this by saying I have always loved British Airways and has always been my first choice for London- Houston, JFK-London flights for years. I had a early flight. Checked in in ample time before my flight. I went straight to the Concorde Room to have breakfast. What I was met with was basically a cafeteria style, self serve service. There was no table service, two people working behind the food counter. I met an English couple while waiting in-line to put in a simple scramble eggs on toast order as they and we were both told that the toaster was in front of us, and we needed to toast on own bread. It all went downhill from there. The wait was long, traveling on your own you had to keep an eye on your table to make sure it was not taken, tables were left unserviced and unclean. I carried some dishes to the front just so I could be seated. Boarded plane, seated, and started looking around and the carpet was dirty. It looked as it had not been vacuumed from the last flight, which did not give me a clean and comfortable feeling. The the steward came to me and said they ran out of women's toiletry kits because they do not allot according to reservation, but normally catering to men traveling on business and not women traveling on pleasure. He offered a Men's toiletry kit and a Business Class kit. The food was served. I started with their appetizers which was all dry and very unappetizing (and I am not picky), but for me to find it unappealing it has to be poor. Then the entrees were short and I had to choose a second choice. Any one of these events would be okay- even though they advertised that all is superb, but everything, constantly occurring had me regretting I paid for First and have sworn, for the price differential vs service and quality,  Business Class wins out hands down. The food was far from septacular or tasty - it felt overcooked and choices limited and short. The Pilot did come out and asked if BA could call me and he was very apologetic (I guess a Steward/ess mentioned the faux pas's  - I consented. Disappointment ran consistent from beginning to end - no call, no email, no apology - in my opinion that is the epitome of service from beginning to end. It left me feeling that BA really did not care about any of it - the service in lounges, the appropriate allocation of food, kits, cleanliness- all of it. My flight back to JFK I flew Business. It was comfortable. Though there was less space in First class seats years ago, but the service was brilliant and comfortable and the food was delicious. I am sad my experience this time could not compare to years gone by - even if it was more simplistic. My review is for First only."

Ironically, they ran out of the South African white wine. The entertainment system wasn't working for most of the flight. British Airways should provide an iPad alternative in First when that happens. PJs and the flat bed made up with a duvet are good touches, but the flight was too turbulent for uninterrupted sleep.

I recently used Avios to take a short break to Granada with my brother. My normal choice for such a short flight would have been economy because I don't believe the extra cost (whether this be actual money or Avios) justifies the perceived benefits. Regrettably, no economy reward seats were available so I opted for Club Europe. The only real benefit on this particular route was the increased baggage allowance, although this was of no real use for a 3 to 4 day trip! So what did we get for our 'business' flights no lounge at City Airport, no fast track at City Airport, a 'holding pen' prior to boarding with everyone standing around in a small room and no priority boarding. Seats in Club Europe are identical to those in Economy. The breakfast going out was terrible (burnt food along with dried out toast and croissant). The lunch (if you can call it that) coming back was also terrible - a cold salad dish with dried out rolls accompanied by vinegary wine. No lounge at Granada, No fast track at Granada, coupled with a single check-in desk most of the time and long queues I complained to BA about this - the initial response was that Club Europe left the middle seat free to allow more room. Whoever responded obviously didn't even think to check the aircraft, as there is no middle seat on the Embraer - it's a 2x2 configuration for the whole aircraft. After some considerable persistence on my part, a partial refund of 5,000 Avios each was provided by British Airways.

The last flight BA117 on Wednesday 2 September 2015 the power failed meaning all the seats in my section of business class had to be manually positioned. The in-flight entertainment system stopped. The staff were great, but frankly all the company is doing is putting staff in a difficult position. In 2015 my company will have spent £120k on travel to and from London and New York. Too much money for such a mediocre service, aircraft that are many years beyond proper serviceability and a management team focused on shareholder profit not customer satisfaction. What a fall from grace. In August I flew Singapore Airlines London to Melbourne. What a difference in aircraft quality, customer service experience and value for money. Please British Airways, sort yourselves out. Letters to Keith Williams or Willie Walsh are ignored or intercepted by staff. Lots of promises and little or no action. My most recent cabin was held together by pipe insulator. The last one the same, and horrible condensation issue with the air con resulting in a soaked blanket at take off."
2839,False,2015-07-01,Canada,Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,2.0,2,False,"My wife and I flew from Toronto to London (return) using BA Business Class in July of this year. This was part of a ""trip of a lifetime"" we had planned to the UK. We have never flown business class, so decided to spend the big dollars for a return trip. I am not sure if it was worth it at all! Toronto to London was an overnight flight, London to Toronto an afternoon flight.  Ease of booking online was very good, Customer Service on phone was poor (obviously outsourced so a language barrier!). Check in at Toronto was average, nothing above check in at any other counter. Lounge at Toronto very good, great food, drinks, service, facilities. Aircraft cabin with average state of wear Seats - center rear facing seats. Comfortable but lacking any type of space (the lie flat bed was good) Cabin crew were on auto pilot - not rude but certainly not great,  Food was average. The return trip (Heathrow Terminal 5) to Toronto was not really any better. The business class lounge at Heathrow was not good. Lousy food, looks very worn, very busy, travelers sleeping across multiple seats, bathrooms were average .I would have rather taken my chances in the regular lounge area or gone into one of the many sit down restaurants. The distance from the main concourse (after security) to the lounge is quite long and the distance to your gate (especially if it is in the B or C sections) is a great distance, and involves a train ride! Same seat on the return trip, so again average. Food, service etc all average. Overall, we were not impressed with British Airways Business, and would not use them again (consider Air Canada or another airline). I flew Air Transat Club class 2 month prior to the UK, and I enjoyed it a lot more (and a hell of a lot cheaper!) British Airways did not impress!"

Has not flown British Airways for a number of years but they have not improved in this time, food still very mediocre and service the same. You even had to pay in advance to select a seat, which we did. However, when we checked in, we were told sorry crew using the seats you paid for! Still waiting for my refund. Inflight entertainment is rubbish - movies well past their sell by date. Back to Emirates for us."

BA is consistent in the seat types it offers on its long haul fleet, but in-flight service and food can vary greatly. I connected from a Qatar Airways short haul flight in DOH to BA, at Hamad International Airport. I used the Al Mourjan Business Class Lounge and it worked out well. BA's Gate staff in DOH were clearly not familiar with the ""To Fly. To Serve"" slogan, judging by their attitude that day. Apart from a choice of water or orange juice upon boarding the Club World cabin, no service was provided on the very short hop to BAH. The flight attendants (one in particular) who served from BAH to LHR were very good. It was a Sleeper-Service, so the dinner menu was minimal, but breakfast didn't compensate well for that either. Cost-cutting was evident here. Thankfully, I didn't have to jump over anyone to access the aisle as many adjacent seats were empty. The cabin was clean, and AVOD was adequate, though it froze near LHR. The flight landed on time in LHR, but transferring through T5 was chaotic at 6:30 am. Baggage transfer was good."

We had to change the organized wedding date, to another, 3 days later. He received his luggage on a last day of his staying in Nassau. From the first day arrival, BA was contacting us and saying same thing, the luggage is coming next day, and that was for me 3 days, my friend 1 week. When I received my bag, they lost my key, that I gave in airport in Nassau to BA person, I signed the contract that I agree when my luggage arrive they can open it and check it. They lost my key and I had to cut my bag to eventually get my cloths. The plane was old, but pretty well maintained. Me and my wife slept half flight, but when we woke up, the cabin crew told us that we can't have warm food anymore - we had 3 hours to fly, and  we were hungry.

London to Montreal I was in businness class and liked the seats. One flight attendant was Italian and she was informed that me and my collegue are Italian, she gave us a warm welcome and took good care of us during the flight. The amenities weren't amazing - just 1 small lotion, sleeping mask, socks and 1 pen. The food wasn't what you expect from a businness class, it looked like the same as they serve in economy class."

The seats are tight with no storage space for even a bottle of water and the configuration is poor. I had 16K as I was told it is the best seat in the cabin - back corner, rear facing but very private. Forget any meal choice - being at the back means you get what you are given. Wines were ok but the food was ordinary. The crew were probably the best part of the whole experience - but they are nowhere near the standard set by Qantas crew. You can do far better with Qantas, Emirates or Cathay - forget travelling with BA as it's just not worth it."

What a mistake, because despite some of the problems with Chinese airlines, they offer a far superior service to British Airways. The cabin, seats etc were dirty and claustrophobic on this British Airways flight, and I bitterly regret my patriotism in selected them for this trip. Food is basically on a par with many Asian airlines Economy class standards, and you need to be very cautious about believing any of the marketing rubbish that British Airways provide in different areas. This is not a premium experience, and was a true waste of money. Staff were on another planet as far as service was concerned - abrupt, unsmiling and intent on getting service over as quickly as possible, before they retired to gossip loudly in the galley. Using the call button was a waste of time midflight, I guess they were all resting by then. I know that on Air China the wine may be served rather warm, a cold beer is hard to get, and staff language skills are limited to standard phrases, but their staff are cheerful, enthusiastic to serve customers - and their business seats a lot more comfortable. The British Airways motto of flying to serve should be challenged in court as a blatant misrepresentation. Luckily my company doesn't restrict me on airline choice, and this will be my last trip on British Airways, who I first flew in the 1960's when they were a truly great BOAC."

First time flying with two babies, booked the ticket and reserved two seats together sitting together with husband. Both babies are lap seat. Two days before the flight I called the BA service to make sure our seats and ticket are all fine and got a positive answer. On the day of boarding found out out seats are moved apart. For 12 hours flight, our family seats are arranged far apart. After more than 40 minutes standing at the counter waiting for the coordination, we could sit across the aisle when we get on the plane. No food for my 2 year old. If we are not allowed to bring food onto the plane, what do BA expect baby can eat? No help from staff with any service. When babies are crying and very restless  we didn't get any help from BA staff. When I flew with other airlines, flight attendant brought small toys to help distract and entertain baby.

Check in took 30 minutes as the agent was dealing with a couple and escorted them to the lounge and made us wait until he returned. The first class security lane was manned by the rudest staff I have ever come across. The lounge was fine, but it is looking tired. Service good and range of menu was broad and wines good. No priority boarding, had to queue in the airbridge for 10 minutes, no greeting at the door, no escort to seat, no jacket hung up and the seat was dirty (covered in crumbs and other such food). Opened two magazines both torn, ripped and in rag order. Staff very pleasant, professional, and very helpful. Food ok not First class, wines good. The entertainment system was broken and kept rebooting itself. The seat would not lie flat and hard to move. Bought on board duty free and asked would I need a sealed bag to bring it through to my connection told yes. Deplaned, no escort, no gate to go to, given wrong directions to the lounge. Had to clear immigration although not entering the UK, waited 45 minutes to be told duty free I bought on board could not go through I would need to go to check in although told the opposite on board. This was done, had to reclear security again, got to the lounge asked for a shower, told too busy. Connection flight was delayed by one hour, waited at the gate. Flight to Dublin short, salad served and tea. Priority bags were the last bags on the belt. Overall this is not first class, it is not even premium economy. I fly 12-14 times a year and gold level. BA you have lost your edge, I will stay loyal to Qatar, Emirates and Cathay Pacfic whose consistent hard wear and soft product is worth the money and deserves my business. My advice do not waste your money with BA, it's service cutting to the point of insult."

They were polite and totally wooden. On past sectors the older crew took the time to know you and, as a frequent flyer, even say thanks for choosing BA. Hung clothes returned crushed. The dinner was the same as Jet Airways domestic economy. Breakfast at 03.30 a bit of fruit, tepid tea, pastry and egg roll served out of alfoil.

When I pay for a business seat I expect that seat section will be free and I won't be charged for another $147. The b-class is not uncomfortable, just configured weirdly, with little storage space near the seat. The FAs have to constantly lean over the person in the aisle to get to the person at the window, which is annoying and probably makes extra work for them. The food was flat out lousy-it looked like bad microwave fare. The service was OK, nothing special. Although I wasn't going to watch any in-flight entertainment, I did check it out. Pretty meager selection. If given a choice, I don't think I will fly BA after this trip is over."

However, I have found their new policy of asking for £15 for seat selection (even at check-in) really annoying, unnecessary and insulting to loyal customers. Fair enough if they want to charge for pre-booking of seats, but at least they should allow selection at check-in time in line with their direct competitors on the same route (Aer Lingus). I have also found the service (food, drinks etc) extremely poor for the fare charged, even for the short sector. If they continue their money-grabbing policy I will definitely and happily give more of my business to Aer Lingus and Cityjet which operate the same route and seem to not treat their customers as infinite cash cows."

Cramped pods (8 seats across when others have 6), and a tired old plane. I usually fly in an aisle seat but know better on BA, so was in a window seat. The passenger next to me was repeatedly woken as food was handed over or spilt on him. After the service the polite cabin crew disappeared. Only one bottle of water all flight. The food was tasteless, overcooked and the presentation with fast food condiments reminded me of fast food chain. At the price this is the worst product in the skies. Seat was broken and IFE clunky. Being used to CX, QF, SIA, Finnair, Air Tahiti Nui, AA, Lan Chile and more, I hesitate to call it business class because it isn't."

It's been on international and domestic roll aboard other than on a turboprop. My colleague had the same. Officious and uncalled for. Exactly the same cabin bags were rolled aboard 4 days later on the return flight. Seats were economy class and cramped with little recline and less pitch than economy on many airlines.

2978,False,2015-06-01,United Kingdom,Boeing 767,Couple Leisure,2.0,2,False,"It appears BA continues to adopt a “do as little as possible” for this route, presumably due to their monopoly. The aircraft and cabin is looking tired/old, and decidedly mediocre compared to recent business class flights with Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways. Outward excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew. My seat (2K) was shockingly filthy. It had been cleared since the last passenger, but I noticed much ingrained filth e.g. food /drink splatters on the cabin wall, crumbs in seat folds/gaps and stained cover, all sorts of debris on floor in gaps/cracks, and remarkably grimy carpet. Cabin attendant offered me choice of the empty seats, but on inspection these were in a similarly grim state. Seat was OK for comfort, but mediocre IFE choice with very poor quality screen. Meal service was good for food and drink, although dirty environment was off-putting. Lacto Veg’ meal much improved since last tried. Pantry service is underwhelming in places e.g. Mars Bars and KitKats are tragically promoted as retro, but some nice ice cream. Return in 1K, and excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew. I'm ridiculously grateful that this cabin is clean. Tired, so skipped dinner. Decided to watch a short TV programme and found much better picture quality on screen compared to outward, although even less programme choice. I found seat comfort mediocre in bed mode, but got five hours of sleep. The cabin layout is clearly designed to maximise passenger numbers without much thought for their comfort. Awake for breakfast, so when attendants were offering bacon rolls I asked for my wife and my requested Lacto Veg Meals. Staff returned ashen faced, and profusely apologising, with two neatly wrapped and labelled plain white bread rolls. Such bad service, and a lack of joined-up thinking! You couldn’t make it up. Post-flight I found the BA customer complaints dept to be dreadful, and left me far more disappointed with the service than at the end of my flights."

The seating is fine in this class and is definitely worth the extra from standard economy in terms of the leg room. However that's where it ends. The service compared with Business which I travelled out in, is woeful. The BA cabin staff seem to treat anybody not flying in Business or First as second-class citizens and barely do their job. That and the awful food - the worst I've had on a long haul flight has made me seriously re-think my choice of carrier next time I fly the route."
3012,False,,United Kingdom,,Business,2.0,3,True,"This review concerns LHR-BOM in Business Class. I'm not a fan of the BA business class seating. It's very awkward to access the aisle from a window seat and also the practice of having your meals passed over a retractable divider is difficult for both the customer and the flight attendant. Having said all that, the service on board was great, the stewardess looking after my side of the cabin was chatty, friendly and couldn't do enough to help. The seat itself is OK, not overly comfortable but I did manage a few hours sleep. Food is not great on BA though."
3015,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,3,True,I flew from Heathrow to Tokyo Haneda in First. The Concorde Lounge at Heathrow was quite good though I was surprised by how little choice there was when it came to food. The seat on the new First was good. The service was all right. The food on board was poor as it has been each time I've flown First over the years. To find something edible I had to retreat to the snack bar in business. I was particularly disappointed because BA is still my first choice for economy and it is fine in business apart from the bizarre seating configuration.

Shocking service and standards from start to finish.
3021,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,3,False,Flew from Heathrow to San Francisco on May 1st with BA. What a disappointment! I had to pay over £120 to sit next to my husband having already paid for the flight. Then we couldn't access the entertainment for over 90 minutes at the start of the flight due to some technical problem and again later in the flight it went off for about 60 minutes presumably due to the same problem. Our first meal was served more or less straight away and it was OK typical airline fare but there was then over 7 hour wait for the next meal which was laughably called afternoon tea one piece of bread cut into quarters with chicken and a scone with cream and butter. Four hours after the main meal they ran out of snacks and when my husband went in search of something to eat they gave him two packs of nuts and said they were for the return journey! Don't they stock up before picking up the next passengers? Luckily my husband always carries chocolate bars with him as he is diabetic but heaven knows what might have happened had he needed food from the staff. Before half way two of the toilets went out of service so there were some queues. Would I fly BA again certainly not long haul although unfortunately I have to return to Heathrow with them from Boston today.
3027,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,3,False,Punta Cana - Gatwick. World Traveller Plus cabin on B777. I find this particular cabin very noisy possibly due to proximity of the engines. Seats are comfortable and leg room and elbow room significantly better than economy. The front row of World Traveller Pus has even more legroom but be warned that this is a mixed blessing since this row is fitted with shelves for strapping down babies cradles and if you sit next to a passenger who requires this facility then it will severely compromise your space. IFE was OK but nothing special. Main meal was OK but breakfast was an absolute disgrace; a dry cheese croissant and a small granola bar. No alternatives offered. I know this is not business class but for the premium I paid for World Traveller Plus I feel entitled to something better than this really very poor take it or leave it excuse for a breakfast. The drinks service was nothing special either; one round of juice or water before take off an offer of wine with dinner and another juice and water run after dinner. Then nothing until breakfast. Regarding the crew some were engaging and friendly but far too many others were offhand and unsmiling. When in all innocence I used a toilet in the Business Class cabin I found a member of cabin crew waiting for me when I emerged who promptly berated me for my mistake. Fair enough but when I explained that other passengers in World Traveller Plus had also used the toilets in Business Class I was virtually called a liar. I backed off from an argument but I found the experience upsetting and I simply couldn't get to sleep thereafter. I eventually disembarked at LGW hungry thirsty and a somewhat unhappy bunny. In summary World Traveller Plus is probably just about worth it for the extra comfort and space but don't get your expectations too high in terms of food and drink and be prepared for inconsistent inflight service.
3034,False,,Australia,,,1.0,1,False,BA 10 Bangkok to London Heathrow May 26th 2015 World Traveller Plus (Premium Economy). First the positives: check-in at BKK was reasonably efficient the flight departed on time and landed at LHR about 15 minutes early. Unfortunately while World Traveller Plus provides some extra leg room when compared to economy there was nothing else about our flight experience that justified the additional cost of World Traveller Plus. The cabin seating and equipment were tired - the entertainment system was old and barely functional. However by far the worst aspect of the flight was the poor service from the cabin crew who almost without exception appeared uninterested in customer service to the point of rudeness. Their strategy seemed to be to minimise their exposure to customers in order to maximise the time they could spend in the galley at the rear of the aircraft. After the first meal service (an uninspiring Chicken Curry with boiled to death broccoli and carrot not remotely resembling the misleadingly optimistic descriptions found on the BA website about the supposed 'enhanced' dining experience of World Traveller Plus) calls for service went unanswered for lengthy periods of time. It seemed the only effective way to obtain further service was to walk to the rear galley where staff congregated and made it clear they did not appreciate being 'interrupted' barely acknowledging requests while continuing their conversation and grudgingly fulfilling requests to a bare minimum. In stark contrast to the excellent cabin service food and entertainment options we experienced flying in economy on Qantas to Bangkok the previous day this so called 'premium' experience on BA was extremely disappointing. Our advice: don't waste your money on BA World Traveller Plus.
3057,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,2,False,Over the last couple of years I have travelled to China by Emirates KLM Virgin Atlantic and BA. The next time I travel BA will be my last choice. I got the impression from the very start that BA are penny pinching at every opportunity. Their lounges are basic and the food minimal. Although having a seat on the plane only a few row down from the front some meal selections had run out. The cabin staff hid behind curtains most of the flight therefore service was at a minimum. If you have a window seat you have to straddle the person in the inside seat if you need to get out.
3058,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,3,True,LGW - Antigua - LGW. Easy check in at the Club World desk and then quickly through security etc. Unusually for BA at Gatwick boarding was very well organised and we were quickly on board the ageing 777 - 200. Water or orange was offered prior to take off along with a hot towel. We pushed back from the stand at exactly our departure time and were airborne about 10 minutes later. I can't say the seats were the most comfortable I have ever sat on but the extra leg room in PE did help. Two drinks rounds were served one before and one with lunch. The food was just about OK although I never have any great expectations so I am rarely disappointed. However the size and picture quality of the TV screens was very poor and as a result I decided to read for most of the journey. The cabin crew overall were very professional and as a result we had a good flight. The return flight was pretty much the same although despite being being bronze exec card holders we were refused permission to check in at the Club World desk which as it turned out didn't make any difference. Overall another good experience with BA bar the few issues that I have mentioned.
3064,False,,United States,,,2.0,3,False,LAX-LHR-LAX April return May 14. Another chance to try the A380 product and all seemed well online check in bag drop sensible loading on the air bridge at LAX but once we boarded a self important flight attendant decided she had to check the boarding passes to ensure we were on the right plane on the right day. No you do not we have been checked all the way along. Still even this pitiful attitude could not dampen the sterling job done by the pair of flight attendants we had. They gave Mixed Fleet a very good name. Now having got through everything needed on that trip we had the return. WTP so the food was OK the thing is during the trip the LAX sector had reverted back to the legacy staff. Disaster. The staff tried until around half way through the flight when a woman who spoke with a brogue I guess Eire arrived to take charge and declared the bar closed. So too were snacks of crisps etc. Half way through a long flight? BA claim the bar service and snacks are available throughout the flight. Clearly they are telling lies. This poor creature shut things because she had counted everything. Anyway if BA wish to lie to us we will not be buying from their High Life Shop. It cuts both ways. So to sum up most BA staff really do try to make passengers (the customers) enjoy the experience; certainly I have always flown BA where possible however when one employee on each sector can colour the experience in such a negative manner I shall not be rushing to fly them again. Closing the bar and snacks after less than six hours on a flight of over eleven hours? To Fly to be Self Serving.! I really can no longer recommend BA.
3100,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,False,Flew Gatwick to Kingston 13/3/15 return 27/3/15 big disappointment had to climb over strangers legs to leave seats. Not all options of food available if your at the end of the meal run. Need to pay to sit together separated from my husband who was next to a nice bloke who was happy to move so we could sit together BA did not even try to accommodate us. Not worth the money Virgin far superior from their lounge to the flight. Will never travel BA long haul again be warned don't waste your money.
3115,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,1,False,My experience on return BA flights to LHR to Tokyo Narita in April 2015 scores very low. I used to fly on Virgin Atlantic for the same journey on Business Class for the past 10 years so I have something to compare and the fare is always more or less the same between those 2 airlines. Conclusion is that you get far better value and service for money for the Business Class on Virgin was my impression. BA T5 lounge is very photogenic but the reality is quite 'basic' and cheap decor. Selection of food and beverages is limited. In the end I got fed up so I left the lounge to get better food from Wetherspoons! Since I'm small both airlines seats are fine to get a good sleep. On BA you'd still have to pay to select your seat despite paying thousands of pounds! Also if you are in the middle aisle on BA you are right next to a stranger which is awkward. BA gives out Elemis kits. Food: on BA there is a 'fixed' options. For the dessert you have to choose either 'cake' or 'cheese'. Not both. Also not too different a menu from Economy class. BA's service felt extremely limited they don't know your names they just do the very minimum service. BA disappointed me.
3116,False,,Turkey,,,1.0,1,False,17 April 2015 Airbus A320 Business Heathrow to Lisbon. A total waste of money. The food was horrible. A couple of sandwiches and a lousy bread served with jam. There was no entertainment system and the only difference I could find from economy was that the middle seat was empty and a portable table was placed between the arm rests. The seat pitch was pathetic and could not even get a rest. I am very disappointed that I did not choose TAP instead of British.
3119,False,,United States,,,1.0,1,False,"10 April 2015 Airbus A320 Business Heathrow to Rome FCO. A total waste of money. The food was ""tea"" there was no entertainment system and the only difference I could find from premium coach or regular coach was that the middle seat was empty and a portable table was placed between the arm rests. As alcoholic beverages are provided for all classes there's nothing to be gained there the seat pitch was pathetic and aside from having the middle seat empty the only benefit to be had was boarding and de-planing first. Don't waste your money unless someone else is paying for it."
3120,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,2,False,Flew BA256 from Delhi to Heathrow - usual BA issues which have been repeated here many times. Firstly the First cabin was not clean (at all) with debris on the floor food still in the seat - it's pretty pathetic when you have to spend 5 minutes cleaning your area when you board! The food - the food can only be described as truly awful! To be honest I would be complaining if I received this standard of food in economy - the starter was a watery oily leek and potato soup and for the main two small lamb chops overdone in gravy with 6 tiny potatoes that deflated when pierced with a fork. I did not bother with desert! Afternoon tea served up (probably) the worst patisserie I have ever had the displeasure of tasting - completely inedible. The cabin crew were good and pleasant however I was not offered any bottled water for a 10 hour flight. It would seem to me that BA are a budget airline trying to do luxury and failing horribly. Surely management cannot be happy with their current standards but I am struggling to see any level of improvement (I take at least 1 first class international flight every year). Have flown BA for 15 years will now be trying other airlines. The lounge (not run by BA but used by BA) at Delhi was very good indeed.
3122,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,3,False,Substandard food in Business Class (London to Mauritius) arbitrary upgrade policy - as we could not afford Bus Class on return flight booked Premium Economy we told that because we were Bus on way out we would get priority consideration on way back. Charging for Seat selection is a rip off was separated from my wife on way out!
3152,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,False,23/3/2015 LHR-SIN BA011 First. Awful from booking to completion of the flight. As a BA. Gold executive member at time of booking some 11 months ago booked this flight on the new A380 only to be told by BA in May 2014 the equipment had been changed to the extremely old 744 due to technical issues. Sold feeling a little let down secured seats 1a and 2a on the 744 these are the best of a bad bunch as to I wonder why BA squeezes 14 seats into such a small area where other airlines only fit 8 seats into the front sections of 744s'. At the beginning of March I checked the booking online only to find that we had been moved to row 5 in the middle this was not acceptable. I called the BA gold line to object only to be given numerous contradicting excuses non of which were valid whilst on the flight I found out that the passenger in 1a was a lifetime gold member so. I can only assume that rank has its privileges. Now onto the flight arrogant staff with one exception really poor food served at different times as we were in the middle which meant we had different staff attending to us. Plane interior shabby not surprised for a 20 plus year old plane along with the PA being inaudible I felt this to be a safety issue and when mentioned I was ignored. I booked this flight for us a part of a special Far East holiday I had high expectations of BA First which have not been met in anyway what a total waste of money. Will now try to avoid flying BA in any of there classes once I have redeemed my Avios balance.
3153,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,3,True,LHR-PHL return. First only half full on both legs as Club not oversold. Very much better service than when full as crew have time to interact. BA really should consider cutting back the number of seats and sell a truly premium product like so many others have now chosen to do. Food disappointing as usual - much room for improvement here. Decent wines but whites/champagne always warm on the return as kept unchilled during the turnaround. T5 experience fine both ways as mid-week and time of year not so busy. Lounges good and lounge staff friendly both LHR and PHL.
3165,False,,Cyprus,,,1.0,3,False,We travelled CUN-LGW 11 March and it's the last time we will ever travel Business class with BA. No lounge facilities at Cancun only a voucher offered for use in departure area food outlets. On board usual gymnastics to get in and out of seats ran out of food choices for dinner limited choice for breakfast tea served in a cup without saucer. Cabin staff excessively noisy in galley throughout flight. Better value in cattle class.
3168,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,2,False,British Airways business class is outclassed by rivals. The lay out of the seats needs sorting - I do not expect people to step over me when I have my seat extended in order to get out of their seating area. The inflight food was poor. Drinks were offered occasionally - 3/4 times on a ten hour flight - slightly warm coffee - ran out of ice. The idea that you have a selection of food to choose from in the business class galley was a joke. Non business class passengers used business class toilet and then helped themselves to the food. Inflight entertainment very poor. The terrace lounge at Gatwick is outdated - no hot food apart from porridge (we checked in at 9.00am) a few pieces of cold toast plus the usual cold meats and cheese. Booking business class with British Airways is definitely not worth the money.
3169,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,False,"I have to admit to not being a fan of the BA Club World (Business Class) configuration but this is what our travel agent came up with for our direct flight. Seating you head to toe allows them to get in 8 seats across compared to their competitors normal 7. On my flight 11 rows this gave them 11 extra seats good for the bean counters but can cause problems for the passengers. On my flight from MLE to LGW 10 hrs 35 minutes I was in 11B facing forward and in the bed position my feet were on a drop down stool fixed to the back of 10B. The passenger in 10A facing back had to step over my legs to exit their seat and kicked me a number of times as they did this during the long flight. It is illegal to drink alcohol in the airport in Male and so after take off I was looking forward to a cold lager. The drinks trolley came but all the beer including the lager was warm. The FA said that they had no means of cooling the lager on board. I cannot drink warm lager and I am not a spirit drinker and so went without. I settled down to watch a film but my entertainment system would work for about 15 minutes and then shut itself down. No entertainment system and I then found that some of the adjustment buttons on the seat did not appear to be working so it was either sitting up or lying down and risk being kicked. There were 2 meal services on the flight. The first one was OK but when it came to the second one when they got to me last row in the cabin they had run out of food and all they could offer me was a salad. Not the best flight in the world and when we arrived at LGW all the economy bags came off first and the Club bags with ""priority"" tags attached came off last. I have been in correspondence with BA and Customer Relations has stated ""You traveled in the cabin you originally booked. However the meals we serve and our in-flight entertainment system is complimentary and not included in our fare. The BA website has a description of this service which includes: 1) Extensive Flight Entertainment System. 2) Seat Converts to 4 key positions. 3) Choice of light meal or four course dining. BA claimed to be ""The Worlds Favorite Airline"". They are not mine. They also clam ""To Fly To Serve"". Well as they say they did fly me from MLE to LGW bt I am not quite sure where the service came in."
3177,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,2,True,"This is not reflective of BA in general only this particular flight. I flew LHR-ABV on Saturday 7th March. This was the Friday 6th flight that had to be rescheduled due to technical issues. Now if anyone is familiar with this route you will know that service onboard is sometimes not as consistent as say the transatlantic routes. Considering that the flight had been delayed 23 hours one would have though that cabin crew would have been more attentive. This is not to say they were in any way unprofessional they were just in a hurry to give you a drink and your meal. There after you barely saw them! Duty Free sped through the cabin faster than Usian Bolt and landing and immigration cards were handed out just before landing. I was part way through completing mine when I heard the ""Cabin Crew 10 minutes to landing"" announcement! The seat I was sat in had a broken IFE screen hinge and would swing back to the closed position. Fortunately the cabin was not full which is a first for this route! Sadly the seat I then chose also had an IFE issue too - a minor one but annoying nonetheless. Third time lucky and hussar! I must add that the choice of films were rather poor too. The food would have been good save what was on the main menu. It was a choice of Chickpea Tagine Chicken and African Stew. Which region of Africa did that stew pertain to be from lord knows. Anyway I opted for the chicken. I must say I was supremely underwhelmed. It was nothing short of a ""school dinner"": flavourless and unappetising."
3182,False,,Ireland,,,1.0,2,False,"I travel world-wide mostly on business and in Business Class. I don't think I have ever had a flight with BA that wasn't without an issue. Recently and not for the first time I checked in to find that Club Class had been over sold. So lets call it what it is.. Greed it's a disgusting practice. The planes are usually dirty and if you get ""Bumped"" down to Economy the food is awful while the Cabin crew are mostly helpful and friendly you don't see them apart from meal time even when you use the call button where do they go and what and what are they doing?"
3188,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,False,Flight was cancelled with no explanation. No offer of help whilst having to stay the 2 extra days in Thailand. My flight from Bangkok to Heathrow was horrendous. Travelled World Traveller plus which is a total waste of money. We were served a meal within the first couple of hours of the 12 hour 35 minute flight. I was offered beef or Fish. It was actually Chicken. Apart from a tub of Ice Cream the next meal was not for another 8/9 hours. When the meal did arrive it was Pasta or Chicken. I asked for chicken. It was Fish! It was also vile. Sent it back. Judging back the food going up and down the aisle so did several others. I went to the back of the cabin for a cup if tea. I was advised if I wanted more tea could I retain the paper cup as they were running out!!! It was like being on some 3rd World airline. This is BA. Supposedly the flagship airline of our country. It's an absolute disgrace. I have flown for over 40 years and never again with BA.
3197,False,,India,,,2.0,3,False,I fly BA business regularly between Delhi and London. I was surprised at how dirty the plane was - on 2 of my last three flights my table was sticky and the area around me stained. The food quality is generally pretty poor - especially on the Delhi to London leg. Also why not get some decent magazines - Country life Decanter the Economist rather than a dull inflight magazine and a grubby copy of Hello! I residually like BA but they have to up their game.
3198,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,3,False,Flew BA2043 Gatwick to Male in World Traveller Plus. Plane a Boeing 777 which was very old and thus the entertainment screen was small. The main dissatisfaction was the food - going out it was the worst that we had ever had in long haul and coming back it was not much better. The choices ran out when the cabin crew got to me (comment someone has to be last and unfortunately it is you sir). I finally got my choice when the Captain gave up his first choice! Other airlines particularly middle east and far east based do a much better job.
3207,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,1,False,Heathrow to Boston on what was once called queen of the sky now grandmother of the sky. Went WTP on ancient 747 with tiny monitors with badly scratched screen and awful selection of movies and music. Food just OK but crew very good. Not worth the money better off in economy.
3213,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,3,True,I flew club world from JHB to LHR on 21/01 on the 747. The flight experience overall was a good one. Sitting on the upper deck of 747 is definitely a must as its a fair bit quieter than the main deck. The check in was a breeze and the staff at the desk were very friendly especially considering I was travelling with loads of luggage bicycle etc. I didn't use the lounge as I know the one in JNB is not very good. The boarding took place on time and we were offered pre takeoff drinks soon after seating. Take off was a bit delayed but smooth non the less. The food leaves a lot to be desired on BA I had the Salmon main course which was very bland. The up side the champagne was perfectly chilled and the desert was yummy. The seat configuration is not the best as you are facing your neighbour. The seat in the lounging position is very comfy but is a bit narrow for sleeping it's also a bit short for taller individuals such as myself. Arrival at T5 was very smooth as I used the fast track lane from landing to climbing in the taxi was less than 30 min. I would definitely fly BA again but they do need to look into the quality of food and the seat configurations for future upgrades.
3217,False,,United States,,,1.0,1,False,"I have been a loyal customer for the last 10 years and have progressively seen the service cleanliness and interest in client satisfaction decline. I just came back from a NYC-LHR-Dubai trip and will not fly BA again. Several reasons: my seat in Business Class was noticeably filthy - crumbs on the seat and hair on my pillow. When I told the attendant she just fluffed the pillow and walked away. I was hounded for not filling out the breakfast form in 5 minutes (the plane had not even taken off) and told that ""I would not get breakfast"". I was served raw chicken and when I expressed interest in another dish was told that all the other passengers had eaten and that there were no more dishes on the plane? The dish was taken away but no follow up or apologies - not even an extra bag of nuts to ensure that I was not hungry for the 7.5 hr flight. Perhaps the most disturbing part of traveling with BA is that the staff are unapologetically arrogant disinterested and unapproachable and any response is as if they are doing you a favor. As a customer paying nearly 10000 USD for a round trip ticket I shouldn't be afraid to speak to staff and highlight a dirty seat or food that is not cooked. The seats on two of the legs were broken and my screen did not work on three of the legs. There are plenty of other first class carriers out there that I will now become a customer of."
3242,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,4,True,Delhi to London in seat 2A 747 aircraft. Very little difference between First and Business in comfort terms and the food was disgusting. Poor choice of entertainment. Only good thing I can remember was a nice white Burgundy but it was probably served in economy too. Will stick to business class in future for the airport fast tracking and lounges.
3248,False,,Belgium,,,2.0,3,False,Miami to Brussels with a change at Heathrow terminal 5. Lounge in Miami was ok ample choice of spirits but very basic champagne. Food: lots of cold cuts cheeses and some pastries. Plane: rather dated 747 and not very clean. FA's very courteous and extremely friendly - great choice of very good champagnes wines and spirits. Where BA fails: the poor quality of the food - extremely basic without any luxury items - not acceptable at all for a First product - IFE just ok. Seat kk - FA gave assistance for the sleeping position. Connecting flight to Brussels: I was informed by the - once again very friendly and courteous FA - that BA did cancel the fruit platter as a special meal. Is fruit also too expensive? Will move to other companies for long distance flights.
3287,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,2,False,"LHR-SFO-LHR. Why do I keep thinking BA will improve? The 747 on this route is falling to bits. Their business class configuration is terrible. Facing a complete stranger having to attempt to climb over other passenger to go to bathroom! Seat narrow and table unusable for dinner unless use knee to hold it up! Food on both legs awful but worse coming from SFO. Also club kitchen pathetic. IFE systems the worst of any airline. BA please travel on Emirates just once and see how it should be done. Staff on way out on upper deck very nice and attentive however on return to LHR on upper deck staff were verging on ""can't be bothered""! Served dinner during severe turbulence which you could not eat so they could get dinner finished and sit down for rest of flight. Had to go to galley to get drink as ignored call button. Then empties sat on table for two hours before I dumped them in galley. Breakfast consisted of hard fruit and greasy bacon tiny roll. Both of which left uneaten. I keep booking through blind loyalty but after Bahrain and San Fran in December decided no more. They have just got too bad."
3292,False,,Austria,,,2.0,2,False,LIS-LHR-VIE on Dec. 8 both legs on an Airbus 320 in Club Europe (Business Class) - both legs on time seats were Economy seats with the middle seat left unsold and featuring the new slim seats which are less comfortable and have a reduced seat pitch – Check-in in LIS was handled by rather surly agents which was untypical for an otherwise friendly airport but Business class waiting lines were very short so overall it was OK. LIS-LHR leg was with a rather lacklustre and inattentive European fleet crew after the initial service of food and drinks further service consisted of clearing the dishes and on board sales. Other than that Business class flight attendants were behind the curtain reading magazines chatting and rather attending to themselves than the passengers. At 11 am the Business Class food served was a plate cold cuts a roll and three thin slices of fruit (basically a make yourself sandwich on a plate). Extremely disappointing and poor for a lunch flight scheduled to arrive in Heathrow after 1 pm. On the LHR-VIE leg service was“afternoon tea”meaning again sandwiches. However this time at least it was more appropriate due to time of day. Full bar service on both flights and the French white wine served was ok. The mixed fleet crew on the second leg was more interested in its job and up to BA standards regarding friendliness and attentiveness. Transfer procedures in LHR Terminal 3 were fast and friendly even the extra security checks required for all transfers at LHR (even Intra-EU) were hassle free and easy. BA’s Galleries Lounge in LHR T3 was again an oasis of rest amid a busy airport; comfortable with excellent drink selection and decent food selection including several good warm choices such as various curries. In Lisbon Portela BA uses the shared Blue Lounge which is small and offerings are rather limited; some limited snacks ok drinks but at least good Nespresso coffee. Although small it was not crowded which is a plus. So BA delivered a good basic product for economy standards but I fail to see any real Business Class service offered here (not seat wise not meal wise not service wise). The only saving grace was the Galleries Lounge in Heathrow T3 and the better service on the LHR-VIE leg. Not recommended for Business Class within Europe based on this experience. (Oneworld Sapphire).
3293,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,False,LGW to TFS in Club Europe. Disappointing that BA has downgraded its CE service to such an extent that it is not really worth paying the extra for short haul. Too little leg room now such that new seats are no different from Economy - yes the middle seat is not occupied but what both my partner and I would like is additional leg room. Not good enough to pay the extra and then have to sit at an angle to fit into the seat. New seats are uncomfortable as well. Lunch service reminiscent of Economy food trays of the 80s too. Cabin crew doing their best with a full club cabin - CE clearly still popular for the moment even with revised cabin layout but for how much longer? Can no longer recommend BA for a four hour short-haul although good time-keeping. Such a shame that BA has allowed this to happen. Think again BA.
3297,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,False,"Travelled Club from MIA to LHR last week having made the outbound trip on a codeshare AA flight (which was excellent!) We paid an extra £170 to pre-book seats upstairs which was ridiculously expensive. It's been several years since I last tried BA Club on a transatlantic flight and I was frankly shocked at how bad the product has become. Compared to the Emirates business class I'd experienced from the far east just 6 weeks before BA are fast becoming the 'Lada' of the Airline business. The seats are no longer that comfortable with the window passenger having to step over the feet of the total stranger in the next row to get into the aisle. The entertainment? Really poor! But worst of all the food! I would have been disappointed to get rubbish like that served in Economy but when one has paid thousands of pounds for the privilege? The breakfast was a joke. A glass of orange juice accompanied by a few slices of fruit and melon and the offer of a tiny bacon roll! My wife had requested special vegetarian meals so when the bacon rolls came along the Cabin Crew first offered her one then said ""Oh sorry of course you're vegetarian!"" and that was it - no alternative! Never again BA!"
3299,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,False,LHR-SFO - Club World. I find myself nodding to the negative yet factual feedbacks of others regarding BA's premium products. Online check in and boarding were smooth and uneventful. That is it! Whoever designed the club world seat needs to have their head examined. The board that signed off on the product should be fired! The seat was narrowed with no space to put your drinks without lowering the dining table. That is just plain stupid. Having to step over another pax to get out of your seat (if seated in window) is another stupid concept! The design offers absolutely no privacy if seated in the aisle. The food was okay nothing to brag about and definitely not at the level expected to see in premium class (compared to the likes of Air France or Lufthansa). Entertainment selection were poor but better than KLM and the screen not of good size. Fly crews were ok. I ordered the beef and the pax next to me did the same. Even though my order was first my neighbour got the last order. Fair enough ended up with Turkey roulade was ok. The crews were apologetic but not attentive. Having flew other carriers I can honestly say theirs little enthusiasm shown by the crew which is a shame. Had an opportunity to look at the 1st class menu. To be frank any carrier who does not offer caviar's in its first class cabin in my view is out with the time. Making this observation because in 2 months I will be travelling to Mexico and the price comparison between Lufthansa and BA are not far apart (former slightly less) but I suspect flying Lufthansa is likely to be more enjoyable than BA based on the experienced of this journey. Will see if the return flight might tilt the view to the (+). I would not pay the published C or F class fares on BA. The product line does not equate to the price. BA was the Waitrose and is now between Tesco or ASDA.
3310,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,1,False,The TV is the worst I have ever experienced and I mean of all TVs ever not just airline TVs! The contrast was non-existent and the resolution appalling. It was like watching a grainy black and white picture that was so dark you had to strain your eyes to see (when the cabin lights were off when they were on it was impossible to see!) It wasn't just my seat my colleagues was the same and I could see walking around the cabin that this is the standard of TVs in your cabin not just a problem with mine. The tray table was so flimsy it was barely usable without using your knee to prop it up. The table had about a 15 degree angle on it and drinks slid off twice during my flight - it wasn't even turbulent. Power sockets on a flight originating in the UK and run by a UK airline should be UK sockets not US sockets! The food was adequate but nothing special I've had equivalent meals in economy class on other airlines and other business class meals have far exceeded this! Furthermore my side salad came out frozen not just a bit cold but frozen solid! It had clearly been kept too close to the chilling unit! Finally when the Club World cabin ran out of tonic water there was no attempt made by the cabin crew to go and check the trolleys in a different cabin it was a case of sorry there's none in this trolley so you can't have any. All in all this isn't the level of service that I expect when paying nearly £3000 for a flight. It was my first time flying Club with BA and I had expected a level of service equivalent to business class with other airlines how wrong I was!
3318,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,False,British Airways are not interested in providing normal business class comforts and cuisine or even lounges on some routes. The Cancun route and the Nassau routes I have flown recently show this clearly as they are presumably are not bothered with little or no competition at all. This saddens me that they have made a clear decision that on holiday type routes they will provide the absolute minimum on everything. One example that shows how pathetic it has become with cutbacks out of many problems I encountered on these routes is that the food was so awful on the Cancun flight recently that we merely asked for cheese and biscuits in business class to be told that we could only have one packet of two biscuits each as BA only allocated one packet per person. The staff all agree that this was pathetic! No lounges at both these airports either and queuing of business class and economy all together no attempt to really show you paid extra for your ticket.
3323,False,,Netherlands,,,1.0,5,True,AMS-LHR-JNB and CPT-LHR-AMS in club. 767 between Amsterdam and London is just wonderful Love the front cabin. A380 to JNB. This was a late departure. I could see - from the lounge - the A380 arrive at the stand some 30 minutes prior to boarding obviously arriving late from another destination and even though it doesn't require a lot of inside-knowledge to see that such a plane can not be 'turned around' in 60 minutes. However BA did not feel there would be a delay until it called all it's premium passengers from the lounge and had them lined up in 4 separate lanes in front of the counter then announcing a delay of 15 then 30 then 45 minutes: How to get your most appreciated customers furious never hear so many complaints on an airline even before the flight started: terrible ground management: not a good start. Upperdeck club seating is absolutely wonderful and this plane is so quiet that you can hear everything. Never realized how much snoring is going on at night first time I had to use earplugs. Food was just terrible and how BA gets away with having pepper and salt in the cheapest of the cheapest sachets just baffles me. The flight to Jo'burg was obviously done by the more senior crew who have incredible charm wit and the most entertaining sense of humor. That opposed to the 'new crew' on the way back from Cape Town. Old 747 with spacious seating all fine. Crew stressed running all the time no manners no sense of class and definitely no sense of humor. Food was slightly better on this long flight but way below any other European carrier I flew. It was my first time in club on BA I love the seat very comfortable for sleeping. There is a lack of space to put your stuff but other than that: a really nice product. BA lounges definitely stand out in the level of catering (food). Transfer at LHR T 5 was quick and easy but terminal itself is a tacky shopping mall and how - so soon after being delivered as new - half of it was blocked for remodelling. My return to Amsterdam on a new A319 was great. Good breakfast and seating is fine.
3330,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,3,True,LHR-HEL Club Europe / HEL-LHR Economy. Club has improved a lot. Great service from staff. Greeting you by your name. However the food was just cold cuts and salad - dessert thin slices of fruit. The new seats are not very comfortable but I sat in the first row so had ample leg room. Not sure if worth a full fare but as a part miles ticket it was enjoyable. The return in economy was fine. Again the new seats are not comfortable - much prefer the old ones although the cabin does look very nice. In economy you were served a sandwich and drinks including beer. I fly the same route regularly in Finnair and BA is a superior service. The flight attendants did a good job. Not overly friendly but quite attentive. The lounge at LHR terminal 3 is ok but breakfast was pretty bad. Egg muffins with no taste at all - do recommend Club Europe but only when not paying top fare.
3334,False,,United States,,,2.0,3,False,"LAX-LHR-LAX on the A380.The first thing I noticed: You can no longer upgrade with Avios. Unlike the days of BA Miles any attempt just brings up ""No Availability"" or the web-site simply tries to make you buy an upgrade. Not a good start. Next up at LAX the plane was a good hour late arriving. Finally boarded and the flight was OK. Food was from the Club World menu (WTP) seating fine enough wine good IFE but then landing late at LHR a delay because ""An airbus was at our spot"". Next the airbridge will not work followed by an airbus is in our spot. Over 35 minutes wasted sitting there with children bullying passengers. If the pilot wishes to lie please be consistent. Route back all quite normal but I feel somehow BA have thrown the baby out with the bath water. As a share holder I prefer discounts to dividends which are doubtful ad I preferred using miles to upgrade (try finding flights from the US you can book with ""Avios"" and finally why did that pilot lie to all of us sat there waiting to park? Time to stop collecting miles change credit cards and look for an honest airline I feel."
3343,False,,United States,,,1.0,3,False,IAH-LHR B747 which was old but sat upstairs and it made it very pleasant. They charged $129 extra to reserve a business class seat in the upper deck. Do not care for the seating of one seat forward and one backwards. The food was terrible and they did not really want to serve any drinks unless they had too. Felt like I was in economy. Nuts were in a bag and breakfast was not much better. Flight attendants not very friendly.
3367,False,,United States,,,2.0,3,True,SFO-LHR-DXB and return DXB-LHR-DEN outbound in premium economy return in business. Positives were all flights on time and crews were overall great on all sectors. Was able to upgrade return at check in at DXB for about $1000 which I thought was worth it. I was not too impressed with WTP product - I still had to pay to get assigned seats which is ridiculous when you are paying extra anyway. The 747 the product looks old and tired. Menu is the same as economy even though they advertise that catering includes a business class entree. Catering out of LHR was absolutely atrocious - almost like a TV dinner which is strange as this is their main hub. Return in Club world was a decent product. Lounge had hot breakfast and was quite big and food onboard was reasonable. Second meal service (high tea) was a joke with pre-packaged sandwiches - not too classy. Overall an okay experience but leagues behind EK/SQ/CX. Not sure when European airlines when if ever will catch up.
3368,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,1,False,LHR-MAD Club Europe A320 Seat 2A 15.25 hrs departure: Newly refurbished cabin looked very classy in dark brown leather. Crew was excellent was start to finish. However those new seats are a catastrophe. There is not enough leg room they hardly recline and it's not possible work on a laptop. That's in Business Class. It is just like Easyjet seating but with a business fare price tag. Food consisted of some finger sandwiches and a scone with jam. Really? The flight gets in just before 19.00 hrs local time. Wouldn't a light dinner be more appropriate? Terrible disappointing experience. These new seats have to go and food must improve.
3375,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,3,True,I travel to and from Singapore on BA in Club world most months but this was my first time on the A380 for this trip. On the whole - their staff on the ground are polite and well informed. Positives for this flight - good lounge in Singapore - the food has improved but it can be crowded. Club class cabins seem fairly spacious - (I was upstairs) but not as good as the 747. Excellent bathrooms - really spacious. One member of the flight crew was excellent and worthy of a gold star for maintaining good humour and excellent service Larger film selection than on the 747 Negatives - The food - awful - they've reduced the menu choices and the beef was inedible. Staff - apart from the member of the flight crew above the others were surly and uncaring - they are the face of the airline and could be so much better. I will fly with them again but would like the staff to be pushed on politeness and courtesy.
3378,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,2,False,LAX/LHR. The flight started badly with the lounge facilities (or lack of) at LAX. There is no First Class lounge anymore – and worst still its a communal Business/First facility shared by BA Qantas and Cathay Pacific. Two hours before my flight it was a zoo. Rammed with around 300 passengers from 3 flights. The food and beverages was to a very high standard. There was no separated boarding lines for First passengers. Flight left on time and dinner was an ordinary affair. A poached salmon starter was neither here or there. Luke warm soup. A rather nice but not exceptional Italian style chicken dish. All served with cheap canteen style cutlery - long gone is the nice silver-plated cutlery they used to offer. Wines were fine. Turn down bed service reminded me of why I don't like the new BA First class seat. The silliest aspect has to be that you either have a seat or a bed – and no adjustable foot rest. In bed mode and mainly thanks to the design of the centre console housing the table - the bed is to narrow. I am 6 4” tall and not overweight. It's very awkward and uncomfortable. BA in old first I am sure use to give you a foldable mattress – now they don't. You get a thin duvet. This makes the bed incredible hard; and during turbulence its a hard uncomfortable to ride. I don't think I slept more than an hour in the whole flight. The tight confines of the compartment means you have to be a gymnast to get in and out when in bed mode. This fare is sometimes as much as £7000 – one way and it's not worth it. What amazes me in the competitive world that BA operate is that they don't seem to look at the competition. They trumpet they are the best and yet they are not. Mind you on the LAX route the only alternative is AA – and they have little ideas on quality in First Class. When I look at what SIA Emirates (the best in my view) and Etihad offer BA do not come close. BA often charge more than anyone else for a frequently inferior product. In fact over the last ten years the prices have sky-rocketed and the quality and standards have sky rocketed as well - downwards!
3389,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,5,True,BA268 LAX-LHR seat WT+ on the A380. Check in was quick as was security and the Oneworld lounge at TBI is pretty good although very crowded. Boarding pretty quick on a packed flight. I found the crew seating and PTV to be consistent and very good. Flight left more or less on time and landed 30 min early at T5 bags seemed to take ages coming off but a pretty good flight. I don't know what has happened to BA's food offering in WT+ but it has gone down hill recently the 2nd meal wasn't worth serving otherwise good service on a very nice aircraft.
3391,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,3,False,LGW to Cancun - flew with BA in CW. The galleries lounge at Gatwick offers a terrible service - food normally consists of poorly made sandwiches pasta and other non discript offerings! Priority boarding was announced for those travelling in CW unfortunately this was not managed and it just turned into a free for all. The crew were friendly and offered a good service. BA's club product is now very dated and they need to look at ways to improve the comfort and inflight service. The so called CW pantry is laughable soggy inedible wraps pasta served in plastic containers crisps and small chocolate bars is not acceptable in this day and age. The inflight meal was adequate but not memorable the afternoon tea was somewhat better but no care went into it's presentation the sandwiches were left in their plastic wrapping which was disappointing. The return flight was awful the crew were miserable and clearly didn't want to be there. One member of the crew was very rude to an elderly lady who was clearly having issues adjusting the seat and dared to ask for help. The meal just awful dry bland and totally inedible. The breakfast served prior to landing at Gatwick consisted of a bacon roll which was vile the bread roll was rock hard and should not have been served. Very poor flight which was made worse but a very inattentive and miserable crew.
3397,False,,Belgium,,,1.0,3,False,BRU-Toronto-BRU 1st class. In BRU check in passport control (very long queues) security fast track and lounge just fine but nothing very special. Security in T5 with extra long queues and very little fast track. Almost none. Lounge in T5 a bliss in all respects. Boarding ok although gate in T5b miles away. Flight itself a disaster old tatty B747 in need of an urgent revamp. Very used and ran down seats. Cabin full so crew although quite experienced busy food options were gone fast and service not that great as in the past. Ran out of champagne. Food not good at all. Inflight entertainment and videos a bore with very old titles. Bags not first out. Return again same experience although a 777 good check in and security fast track - lounge ok with option to dine before flying which I took in case food was same disaster as flight in. Not full cabin this time so a little better service although quality is still zero. Again London T5 lounge a breeze and fast and short flight to BRU.
3410,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,False,"I have after years of loyalty finally had it with BA. Every flight is late the catering gets worse and worse and the attitude of the crew has also deteriorated. I have taken 5 flights in 2 months and every single sector has been late. Even the crew in first class have no idea what ""service"" means - I have to ask for things 2 or 3 times I am not offered anything unless I ask the food is inedible (they tried to serve me a poached egg which I could have played squash with) they ran out of bottled water in a flight out of LHR I cannot find any flights when I can use my free companion voucher or use my miles to upgrade. they won't even allow my PA to deal my flights for me. it just seems the rules and attitude of their management has become so far removed from their promise To Fly to Serve."
3424,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,4,True,BA285 LHR-SFO seat 13a in WT+ on a pretty old 747-400 check in and security at T5 very quick I used the lounge at T5-B which was nice and close to the gate flight departed and arrived 1hr late. Crew very good the seat PTV and food not the best on this flight. I've used BA a lot over the past 2 years and find them pretty consistent although I've also noticed that service along with seats PTV of course is much nicer on the newer A380s or the 777-300s so it's worth choosing your aircraft. Otherwise ok flight.
3431,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,False,BA213 Heathrow to Boston 29/09/14 B747. There was nothing at all to commend this flight. I have had better comfort and service on low cost carriers. The seats must be the narrowest in class for any major airline. The business lounge at Heathrow is not well signed and awkwardly placed at the top of escalators. At 0830 in the morning the tables were overflowing with used crockery and waste food. When staff did appear they did a very cursory clearing job. Never once in two hours did I see any of the sticky tables being wiped down. On boarding I was neither shown to my seat nor addressed by name as I have been on other airlines. When I asked for assistance in putting my hand luggage in the overhead locker - I was told in no uncertain terms staff were not allowed to help. Again I have always had help on business flights on other airlines. In the air the level of discomfort rose as those in the inside seats were forced to jump over my out stretched legs and cabin staff leant over me to serve the inside seats. The level of service could not remotely be considered acceptable for the price paid. Add in poor food and IFE and decision to avoid BA flights in future was made for me.
3434,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,False,"BA176 JFK to Heathrow 13 October 2014. The outward flight had been so awful so the return surely could not be any worse. How wrong I was. Arrived at business check-in at JFK terminal 7. No staff at desk. Boarding pass printed at machine but had to wait nearly twenty minutes to check luggage. Agent was rude and unhelpful. Onto the BA lounge. Sagging shabby seats and no food except crisps. On asking the receptionist where the food was I was told passengers normally use the much advertised ""pre-boarding supper"" facility. Asked when this opened and was told it was not operating. Eventually some badly cut sandwiches and lumps of cheese with crackers appeared. No hot food was available. Two hours before departure the flight was posted as four minutes late. No further information was posted. When I asked for an update thirty minutes before scheduled take-off I was told there would be an announcement shortly. Eventually a barely audible announcement came that the plane was now boarding. The departures board had not been updated so premium passengers were forced to shuffle along with those in the main cabin. Onboard after presenting my boarding pass I was given a grunted down there with no indication as to which side of the plane I was seated. On reflection late boarding may have been a blessing. I lost count of the times I was knocked by oversized and heavy hand luggage. Eventually the safety demonstration was played on the IFE system. The sound was inaudible. Surely a safety hazard. Similarly all announcements from the cockpit went unheard. We took off one hour and fifteen minutes late with no explanation given for the delay. The wine selection was very limited on the flight as was the menu two choices of main course and only one dessert - I asked if I could have the advertised ice cream snack for desert to be told there was none on board. Food was barely edible. Service was poor. The cabin crew seemed intent on throwing trays round as fast as possible. My salad was served with desert (which I did not want) on the tray. The main course was overcooked beef near raw vegetables. I was made to feel a nuisance when I asked for a second glass of wine. The narrow seat converted to a narrow and not very comfortable bed. Other carriers provide mattresses and duvets. BA seem to think a tacky blanket will do. The whole service has been downgraded to the standards I would expect in economy class. The nicieties that used to mark business flights have been lost in the pursuit of profit. Given that BA charge far more that their competitors for this route I was thoroughly disappointed. I will not use any BA flight again if there is an alternative available."
3449,False,,Spain,,,1.0,1,False,BA038 PEK to LHR 28-09-14 Business Class B747-400. First time I have flown BA long haul and in view of the many unhappy travellers on this site - I was keen to see for myself. I can honestly say I have never experienced such a dreadful flight. Antiquated and filthy plane is an experience I would never want to make again. The seating in Business class downstairs is a disgrace I was unlucky enough to have the aisle seat 17G which turned in to a flat bed so narrow my body and I am small was over the main aisle when asleep being continuously bumped and pushed. Absolutely no privacy in this seat and every one coming out of the toilet and standing and waiting the kitchen area could see my every move. Completely unacceptable. No mattress and only a small blanket. There is nowhere to put even a pair of glasses or a bottle of water once the tray table was put up (necessary to sleep). To get to the centre seats where my husband was - a dirty plastic ‘window’ had to be slid down and hot beverages and food had to be passed across the whole time encroaching on my personal space (what there was of it.) My husband said the middle seats trapped passengers in and getting out involved stepping over people. Extremely difficult for short people. The whole design of the business class seats is very uncomfortable and seriously flawed. The food was badly presented and unappetising. The PA system from the flight deck was inaudible I could not hear the Captain in the pre flight information announcement The other issue was a very mediocre in flight entertainment system which took an hour to get going and even the flight tracking information was not available for the whole flight. They weren’t overly concerned just superficial apologies. The toilets were filthy and grimy. The floor edges and all around the basin area where bits were falling off were thick with dirty grease. I looked into the galley and that too including the floors and edges of preparation benches was full of grime. Total disgrace. The Cabin Crew seemed in a state of disorganised chaos having a great view of seeing it all from my seat. Very little contact with passengers other than rather arrogant looks all round. Needless to say I will never travel BA long haul again. They need to get on to an Emirates Airline and see how it should be done. As a regular long-haul traveller on Emirates the difference between these companies is indisputable. Perhaps the so-called ‘loyal’ BA customers have never been on a Emirates flight to compare the difference.
3452,False,,Australia,,,1.0,1,False,Don't even think about flying on this airline. Booked paid for and confirmed last February for a premium economy flight Singapore to Sydney for last Saturday. When I checked in at Changi the check-in staff member told me the incoming flight from London was overbooked and I was downgraded to economy (against my wishes obviously). I would never have booked BA but for the premium economy offering so huge disappointment. GB75 compensation is simply not good enough. Add to that the economy meal was inedible (what did they do to the seafood curry). Never again.
3461,False,,United States,,,1.0,2,False,Just took British from London to Seattle. Tired airplane. Flew business class. Very basic service. No wifi. Nobody checking to see if you were interested in something to drink. Basic packaged food. Very disappointed.
3467,False,,Canada,,,1.0,1,False,Flew from IST to LHR on September 29. In short an abomination for a business class flight lasting nearly 4 hours. It started with a dirty dingy cramped lounge with very limited and low-quality food and drink selection and located very far from the boarding gates. I have used the Star Alliance lounge at Ataturk Airport and it is light years ahead of the BA lounge. The plane was an ancient B767. The business class seats had little leg room or recline were packed out hard and very uncomfortable. It took 1 hour for any drink or food service to start and we were served warm champagne and a small bag of stale nuts. This was followed by a hot meal which was totally different from that described in the menu which had been handed out and this became apparent only when the food service began. There were only two choices nothing vegetarian. The crew were disengaged disinterested and dismissive. The entertainment system consisted of only several old screens suspended from the ceiling and showing the movie Godzilla which doubtless was a big hit with the 12 year olds in the audience. At the end of the flight we were given fast-track cards to speed up our passage through customs. Unfortunately only 3 of the 6 fast-track booths were open and we ended up effectively in the slow-track line. To add insult to injury this business class flight cost $200 more than that of its competitor Turkish Airlines and bore little resemblance to the business class service and cabin described on the BA website. Shame on British Airways for this product.
3473,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,2,False,LHR to YVR. September 29 2014. I've been a loyal BA passenger for years but after three recent flights that's not going to be the case any more. How BA have the audacity to screen 'BA A Very British Airline' on their IFE is beyond me! While the film chronicles the supposed high standards and rigorous staff selection and training the reality is altogether different. The food on BA85 LHR to YVR was atrocious - dried chicken sitting in a dubious brown 'sauce'. The service was unsmiling unhelpful and inattentive. BA used to have a good IFE selection. Not anymore! Very unimaginative selection of films TV and audio programs. I've recently travelled on Qantas and Air Canada on long haul and both carriers far superior to BA. Air Canada has significantly improved it's standards.
3478,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,2,False,BA 084. YVR to LHR on August 28 2014. Premium economy. Much below previous experiences flying in this cabin on BA. Staff were indifferent and inattentive. The meals were deplorable! Despite being a small cabin there was only one meal choice left half way through the dinner service - a very heavy and overly rich pasta dish accompanied by an equally heavy piece of dry chocolate cake. Hardly suitable food for a long flight. Breakfast was worse - an equally heavy fruit muffin and tea or coffee. Very poor! A number of seats in this cabin have metal boxes underneath rendering the much-advertised additional leg room useless. IFE far below what it used to be in terms of quality and variety of programming. A very unpleasant experience and definitely not worth the additional cost.
3499,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,False,Flew Heathrow - Madrid return. Have always been loyal to BA but no longer. T5 Lounge overcrowded poor range of food rubbish and uncleared crockery and glasses everywhere - not particularly pleasant. Bags not tagged priority. Fast Track not fast. Service on board to Madrid was exceptionally good and old style BA. Return bags not tagged priority no priority boarding old aircraft rude staff cramped seating poor and cost cutting catering with no attempt at service beyond handing out. Very disappointing experience and unacceptable. Could not select seats on-line for return flight as computer had allocated them. Eventually seats changed when called call centre - told couldn't be done for half an hour and strangely as the conversation moved forward they could do it. Waste of time and energy. Practically everything suggested as part of the Club Europe package didn't happen. Club Europe used to be so distinctive and worth and I always felt it was worth the premium price. To be honest I have cheaper alternatives from closer airports which I will now be using for my regular flights to and from Spain.

3516,False,,Ireland,,,1.0,1,False,First and last time flying with BA upgraded the 4 of us to Premium Economy at £199 each for 4 of us a complete waste of money. Have done this with Virgin on occasions for long haul flights and its so worth the money and not as expensive. Food terrible crew and staff not friendly no drinks offered only when handing out food. None of us could eat the food it was so bad. On a 9 hour flight we were hungry. Don't waste your money upgrading I wish I had read reviews before I left.
3522,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,3,False,"LHR-MCT-LHR. Excellent outbound flight. Tasty food and wine very friendly cabin crew although the entertainment system isn't up to much in terms of choice. Different story on the way back though. Stand-offish cabin crew and no white champagne. Rose only as ""we haven't been fully catered"". Not a big thing but indicative of how slip shod BA can sometimes be these days. The seat is comfortable so I slept all the way back rather than try their food and drink."
3525,False,,Australia,,,2.0,1,False,I'm regularly flying Perth-Hong Kong-London-Port of Spain these days. Perth to London is via Cathay Pacific business class which is excellent. Sadly I then have to swap to BA for London to Trinidad where 'Club World' is a euphemism for 'slum in the sky'. Cathay Pacific business class seats - 4 across the width of the aircraft. BA Club Slum - 8 across. If you're on a night flight that means tripping over people or being tripped over. Decor is abysmal service is average to poor. Seat and personal space design is lousy - but there's not much space to work with. Film choice is limited and the video screen is tiny and reminiscent of old analogue 625 lines TVs of the 80s. The overall impression is a dreary coffin-like space with minimal storage crummy entertainment average food and indifferent service. Don't do it! Fly with someone else - anyone else!
3530,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,3,True,Travelled LHR to Montreal 21st August 2014 and Montreal to LHR 1st September 2014. Aircraft used was a 777-200 with 4 classes. This sector does not normally offer a First service so business class passengers were spread throughout the First and Club World cabins. All flights were on time and the cabin crew were excellent especially on the outward leg. Check in and baggage reclaim were smooth and efficient. The lounges at Terminal 5 are looking tired and were rather dirty when we used them. Food choice was limited although I did enjoy the hot soup. Seating in BA is dated and even BA's new First Class seat is rather disappointing when compared to even business class on carries such as Emirates or Qatar. Food is well below par both in terms of quality and quantity. I know BA is struggling to make ends meet but ultimately it has to appreciate that people paying for premium cabins expect a certain experience and the seat and food make up a major element of that experience. I guess there is little competition for BA on the north Atlantic routes but it helps to explain why their share of routes to the Far East and Australia are diminishing.
3533,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,False,"We flew BA Gatwick to Grenada - first time with BA and only due to dates having been dedicated Virgin customers. We upgraded to ""Premium Economy"" and apart from the extra leg room (ideal for hubby but no odds to me at 5'3""). No benefit and total waste of money at almost double cost of upgrading with Virgin! Service was not great and food was awful - ""welcome on board"" drink in Premium Economy was orange juice in round plastic carton. Virgin offers orange juice or champagne in a glass. No idea what food was on offer as no menu provided and just a disgruntled ""chicken or beef"" response when asked stewardess. Old and tatty plane very small TVs. First and last time flying with BA - will change dates of holiday in future to ensure Virgin flight. Overall this over-priced upgrade didn't even compare with Virgin's economy service. I would strongly recommend don't waste your money or better still go with Virgin."
3534,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,False,When will they learn. I flew BA to Dubai last Friday in business. Let me sum it up. Boring food surly crew dirty plane and expensive. Can the product get any more unimaginative. The inflight entertainment was out of touch with modern media the screen so poor I couldn't see the movie and gave up. The sandwiches that you get when you land are so awful that I think any frequent flyer is awfully fed up with them the crew make you feel that you are in their way and the plane is (again) horribly dirty. Coffee was spilt on all the wipeable areas around my seat. In business you expect better. It is just not an enjoyable or fun experience by any means and they never upgrade you or take care of their frequent flyers. When I can I chose a different airline.
3536,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,1,False,"I have flown twice with BA now in business class (to and from Delhi) and I have to say it has been absolutely poor! Me and a few colleagues flew out to New Delhi for a business trip. BA were the pioneers of aircraft's after all they did create The Concorde. Key word in that is ""were"" they've basically turned into a no frills airline. Allow me to explain: The blue worn carpets padded fabric seats with stains worn out grey plastic panels with little grains of grit and dirt get into and a TFT which had the same image quality as VHS tape! The decor looks like it was directly taken out of the 1980 film Airplane! You still get the odd knock on the legs when economy passengers are boarding then plane with hand luggage as there is no private space! Staff were fine but flying business class a customer should get a wow factor - and there was none. The plastic translucent slider that divides the seats had been battered from being shifted up and down when the crew serve the food and drinks. The toilets are exactly the same as economy except in Business class they stick a plastic flower in a glass. The food was OK but again nothing special. Normally its the little things that make the differences but with BA they need a total make over. For a flight that happens everyday from London to Delhi BA should be doing more. The decor of the plane matched the experience I got with BA dull. I won't be flying long haul with them again. My advice - avoid BA and before you book your flights have a look online at what other airlines can offer you."
3540,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,False,"Travelled as a family of four to the Maldives. Despite numerous requests many weeks in advance we didn't get seats together on the outbound journey. The plane was old and the entertainment system antiquated. This seems to be an issue on BA routes with little competition it was a similar story when we flew club to Mauritius. On that trip the entertainment system failed all together. On the return journey from Male I watched what I thought to be a three part crime drama called ""the tunnel"". Only after watching the third part did I discover that there was a fourth or more! Why? Why would you not have all the story? This experience aside many airlines have better entertainment systems in economy than the BA service in business on this route. When you are paying this kind of money to take two children business class you want good entertainment to keep them occupied. They don't need the space! Would also have been nice to sit together! Food was grim my ten year old son who normally devours everything ate nothing on both legs of the trip. A ten hour flight with travel at either end is a long time without food. There seemed to be a hurry to serve the food throw a bottle of water at you and then shut down service until an hour before arrival. On the outbound journey I pressed the service button after 15 minutes it self cancelled. Pressed again 15 minutes later it self cancelled. I returned my glass to the galley myself the staff were so busy chatting amongst themselves they didn't notice me. Presumably this is why they didn't see the service request either. On the return trip service was a little chaotic and well below standards you should expect. Food was equivalently poor. This is the second BA business class trip I've taken to the Maldives and each time I have been disappointed given the cost. I've also travelled economy on Emirates to Male which was actually better and business on Emirates which was fantastic. I know BA have monopoly on the direct route from Gatwick to Male but I will be going via Dubai on Emirates in future."
3553,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,False,Gatwick to Cancun 777-200 club world return in July. Old plane which I think BA use out of Gatwick. Food - I can't understand how they can get it so wrong. We flew Virgin upperclass to Cancun but had to use BA this year due to date's will not use BA again. Cabin crew not too bad but could be better. Save your money or go with Virgin.
3556,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,False,We paid £2500 to upgrade to world traveller plus when we got to departure lounge we were upgraded to business class which was brilliant but air hostess made a point of letting us known plus other people that we had a free upgrade. On the return journey in world traveller plus not happy table broken and air steward very sarcastic food very bad plus stewards seemed as if they were doing you a favour. Paid a lot of money to fly to Maldives have no choice to fly BA to go direct stewards male or female need to remember that we are customers paying a lot of money for a service.
3567,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,2,False,Sad to say BA missed a big opportunity when their new 787 and A380 entered service. Same old sub standard business class seating as on the retired 747s. Compared to many airlines the BA premium service is poor and I don't know how they keep a 4 star rating. The cabin crew were excellent though I will concede. Food was very poor with my steak ruined because it was swimming in grease (laughingly referred to as jus) which mixed with the hollandaise sauce to make a disgusting mess. The 787 was good and BA have improved their IFE system but screens are small and have to be stowed for take off and landing unlike those in economy and premium. Pay more get less.
3577,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,2,False,Travelled LHR-YYZ BA97 on 9 July returning BA96 28July. Check-in at LHR an absolute breeze including security which took only 5 minutes. Galleries Lounge at the south end of T5 awful with poor food dirty furniture and smelly toilets. Outbound aircraft was G-BNLG surely one of the most ancient 747s in existence judging by the state of the interior at least in the main cabin. On boarding all the window shades were down (10.20 departure) and stayed down for the entire flight including take-off and landing most peculiar. The head cabin service person said it was to keep the sun out - I have questioned if this is a new BA policy for daytime flights. Departed and arrived a few minute late no issue. Food and service very average as usual nowhere near the standards of international Business Class elsewhere. Immigration and baggage delivery in YYZ very swift. For the return again the departure formalities were quick and painless ; the lounge at Pearson is ok but nothing special. Aircraft this time was G-BGYC the upper deck was in reasonable condition although as always with BA's Club World seating there is little stowage space and the whole backwards/forwards concept is something I personally dislike. Food almost non-existent on this 2310 departure and most people slept: this would be understandable if a proper breakfast was on offer. Unfortunately it was no better than going to McDonalds with some unripe fruit and a sort of egg and bacon muffin - just awful. Also the person in the window seat did have something to eat and drink and every time the crew member came with his orders he would lower the partition to pass them through with all the disturbance that creates. Is this service policy poor seat design or lazy crew? Flight on time arrival processes ok but baggage delivery slow. All in all the experience was what I expect from BA these days average at best.
3583,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,False,Upgraded to business class on return flight from Verona. Absolute disgrace. Flight left around 11.30pm but lounge closed at 9.20pm. Lounge was awful dirty and very little in the way of business class facilities. Flight was cattle class and I have seen more organisation and courtesy on an easyjet flight. Boarding was like a rugby scrum with no priority boarding and then spent 20 minutes on an a bus with no air conditioning crammed packed in hot conditions. Flight had run out of food. Worst flight in memory and absolute shocking customer service. Absolute joke and how they have the audacity to claim it was business class they should be accountable n the trade descriptions act.
3609,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,2,False,MAD to LCY Business. Great lounge at Madrid flight boarding very good food awful service poor arrival at LCY good however baggage awful all bags through but mine priority last off!
3610,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,True,Flew LCY to MAD in Business only 3 people in a cabin for 12 no welcome no pre take off drinks very poor service awful food warm drinks turbulence as we got in the air dealt with very well. Overall very poor service.
3616,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,False,"LGW-BGI-LGW Club World R/T. Old careworn B777-200. Airplane was not clean both sectors. Food outbound from Gatwick was almost inedible and unbelievably they also ran out of choices. Inbound airplane toilets reeked. At least food on return was slightly improved. Cabin Crew both sectors were simply going through the motions and were rushed / robotic. The Club World seats are narrow and uncomfortable. The inflight entertainment system was a bad joke. Screens poor and tiny selection of movies. BA's so called Business Class experience is woefully outdated and an extremely poor product when compared to other international carriers. I am amazed that British Airways standards are so low and they get away with it. This is mere A to B transport. What is missing from their Business Class is ""class""."
3617,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,1,False,Flew LHR to Mumbai return with my husband - very disappointing. The Galleries lounge at Terminal 5 was overcrowded noisy and had the feel of a cafeteria not the tranquil haven suggested by BA. The food was below average. Unable to avail ourselves of the spa' facilities as they were fully booked. Not enough toilets for the number of people in the lounge and my husband had to queue! We had to pay extra to guarantee 2 seats together to the tune of £240. When we boarded the aircraft (Boeing 747-400) the cabin crew appeared rushed and flustered they were not forthcoming with drinks or refreshments or particularly welcoming. The 'yin and yang' seat configuration didn't work out well for us as we continually had to lean forward to talk to each other. The seat comfort was okay but quite narrow. My IFE did not work on the return flight. The in-flight food was above average but not outstanding. Check-in at Mumbai for the return flight was very slow. We were kept waiting for at least 40 minutes with no apology for the delay. The business class lounge at Mumbai is appalling cannot be described as business class at all. No facilities the food very poor both in quality and selection and had clearly been hanging around for some time. The whole experience of BA's Club World was seriously underwhelming and we will not fly with them again.
3618,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,3,True,LHR-CPH-LHR. Business class on the way out and economy on the return trip. Flight on time on both trips staff as usual excellent both within the airport and on the planes. No inflight entertainment at all both operated by A320's whose seats were looking just a little tired. The biggest gripe I have is the food on the business flight we had some sandwiches which were bordering on being stale and on the return trip was a cold chicken wrap which was very short on imagination. Quite disappointed that the food appears to have gone downhill badly since our last flights. Come on BA these are the sorts of things which gave you a clear lead over most of your rivals.
3628,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,5,False,LHR-YVR-LHR. Flew in in First on very shabby 744 which was nothing like First was displayed on the BBC documentary about BA. Squeezing so many passengers into the nose of a 744 is a joke. The staff both ways were excellent and attended to the half empty cabins with great attention to detail. OB were the old contract crew and IB was a standby mixed fleet crew not normal on this route. Food from LHR was palatable and from YVR was awful. On the return leg the IFE was faulty. The fast track OB was a free for all as we were bus fed to the aircraft on return how it should be. I feel the BBC has hurt BA with First passengers having their expectations raised to abnormal levels only to be let down by an average product on very tired equipment not as shown on TV. We were generally happy due to the fact that I used Avios and an AMEX voucher for the flight if we would have paid for the flights then it would have been disappointing and would have chosen Air Canada. BA really do need to sort out their dated equipment sooner rather than later before more premium clients opt for other carriers especially on the middle eastern and far eastern routes. We will continue to use BA due to the Avios rewards which demands loyalty for financial reasons I could not recommend for passengers having to pay for either CW or First.
3630,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,2,False,I flew Glasgow-Gatwick-Vegas-Gatwick-Glasgow. I have flown this way before as I get to put my baggage on at Glasgow and forget about it. Glasgow-Gatwick no real comment other than cabin crew don't do much more than the minimum. Flew Premium Economy on a 777-200 flight was full. Premium cabin is cramped and a fair distance away from the Toilets as you are not allowed to use the toilets at the front again cabin crew do no more than the minimum food just about acceptable. Return flight of the same standard they kept trying to say I was booked back to Edinburgh took them an age to sort this out breakfast is a bit of a joke have found when flying BA that its best to carry snacks as they don't over feed you. Of course when I got back to Gatwick I ran into the French ATC control strike no announcement made. After having to hang around Gatwick all day I finally got a flight to Glasgow at 8pm at least my luggage arrived well done to BA there. When I made a comment to BA customer service I was told by them that my flight(s) had been cancelled due to Aircraft unserviceability when I queried this the respondent confirmed that aircraft u/s could offer no explanation as to why I was told different. I would like to complement BA but Virgin totally beat them hands down.
3647,False,,Australia,,,2.0,3,False,"LHR-SEA in ""first"" class. The experience was really a step back in time. Having arrived in London on JAL after an exquisite experience in their 777 first class I had high expectations of my premiere flight in BA first. Suffice to say I won't be back. Whose idea was it to jam 14 seats into a space that quality airlines fill with 6 or 8 seats? It's crowded ugly and lacks privacy. The whole cabin - and this is 'new' first I might add - feels pretty cheap and is already showing signs of wear and tear. The seat itself is narrow and displeasing. Crew were cheerful and professional but the food would be considered business class standard on world class airlines. That sums it up really - BA is simply not offering a world-class product. I can't imagine why anyone would put down the money they charge for first class unless there was no high-profile Asian or Middle Eastern alternative available and even then I'd probably go out of my way to avoid them. I suggest that BA product managers might want to go on a world tour via Abu Dhabi Tokyo Hong Kong and Singapore and try out the competition because it's plainly evident that they either have no ideas or just don't care. There is apparently a ""new new"" first class planned for the 787-9 when it enters service with BA and I sincerely hope that both the hard and soft products will be worthy of being branded ""first class""."
3650,False,,Thailand,,,1.0,1,False,London - BKK Premium economy 19/6/14. I always travel EVA Air business but this time I had to get into BKK early having been told by many that BA Business is at best rubbish I decided to save some cash and go P/Economy seat no: 14A remarks on flight seating at best ok service seemed tired but the real downer was the food the plane was nowhere near full but by the time they got to me most of the food had gone and I was left with some sort of pasta dish - totally inedible. I must admit I didn't put anything near my mouth just pressed one of the pasta flutes - cold dry and hard. I was given a pat of butter type stuff alas nothing to spread it on bread wise maybe it was put there to grease the runners on the seat. Drinks G&T were served once choice of coffee or tea with second course at least I did get first pick had tea a very hard type of cake thing egg sausage mushroom was the so called dish - again poor. The only redeeming factors were I didn't go business class as the seats dated back to the eighties in a 2/4/2 configuration unlike EVA 1/2/1 lie flat and we arrived 20 minutes early.
3665,False,,Canada,,,2.0,1,False,We travelled to and from Europe in business class for a two week Mediterranean cruise. We upgraded to business for the added benefit of sleep. My first impression is that the fleet is tired and not very well kept. The seats were uncomfortable the cabin was dirty and staff were surly. The food as expected on any airplane was adequate though nothing to brag about (take advantage of the scones and clotted cream - their only saving grace). Upon our return we awaited in London Heathrow Terminal 5 for them to put the gate on our flight. It finally appeared 20 minutes before the flight where it showed we were in satellite C - it took us over 15 minutes to get there to have the gate agent tell us we should have been there earlier. She did upgrade us so we thought at least that was a perk. Well I am here to tell all - don't pay the money. There is little to no difference in first class. The seats are just as uncomfortable the food was the same and I still felt like a second class citizen. This time I think it was because were an upgrade so we were always served last and with little selection/choice. To tell you the truth if I had paid for this upgrade I would have been upset as I don't believe this is up to par. We also did a connector flight from Venice to London on the Saturday. The airport was a disaster (3 cruise ships all flying out the same time) no organization from the agents and very little help. When we got on the other side of the check in the multi-million dollar duty free area was amazing but really they should have taken some of the money to deal with the check in area. Upon moving through security we were kept in the dungeon area of the airport to wait with tepid air conditioning while our flight was delayed with no explanation. When we were finally boarded we were told by the captain that the delay was due to thunderstorms and we were still going to have to wait. The last part is not fully BA's fault (they don't design the airports or determine airspace closure) however their agents did nothing to make it better either (by having people out to direct traffic or give us updates). All in all I don't believe I will ever fly BA again - this is unfortunate because they used to set the standard - now they are barely sweeping up the floor (wish they had - at least it may have been cleaner).
3684,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,4,True,LHR to DXB Return. Outbound flight delayed 2 hours just as well as it took over an hour to clear security. Remote lounge quiet nice food and wine. Jumbo on way out new interior new and very good entertainment excellent attentive crew food as usual poor - (recommend you always eat at the airport which given cost of flight one really shouldn't have to). Inbound flight on a 777. Same on way back as on way in except also on time but must commend 2 crew members for their endless patience with one clown of a passenger.
3689,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,2,False,London (LHR) to Houston (IAH) to London (LHR). T5 in Heathrow is crazy We been up and down the lifts and get train to other gates. We got boarding first then people comes in the plane. When the plane was ready to take off then 1 hour later food ready to give out to other people then nothing until 1 hour before we land. The seat was uncomfortable old and tired. The Cabin Crew were so miserable.
3699,False,,Australia,,,1.0,2,False,LHR-SIN in Business on B-747. Hard to find much good to say about this experience. Everything about the trip was chaotic and disappointing. Heathrow T5 a complete overcrowded mess. Flight delayed by 90 minutes as they couldn't get the jet bridge away form the plane and it took far too long than it should've to resolve. And to make it all worse BA had a global baggage IT systems failure which resulted in my bag not making it to Singapore (despite checking in several hours before the flight). The flight itself was average at best. Upstairs cabin comfortable enough although the plane was old and tired IFE limited food appalling. The only positive thing I can say was the crew smiled a few times through the awful flight which at least suggested they were trying. Can't imagine how BA can compete with SQ on this route given the absolutely dreadful nature of what was once a much better airline than it is today. They have no idea where my bag is or when I will get it and you can't contact BA in Singapore on the weekend as they are closed. One just gets the impression they couldn't care less. Would not recommend.
3709,False,,Australia,,,1.0,1,False,Dublin to Sydney (via Heathrow and Singapore). Club Europe from Dublin to London and club world to Sydney. Flight to Heathrow delayed 40 mins due to weather which was fine. Upon arrival in Heathrow waited for an hour for the bus transfer leaving us 30 mins to make the next flight. Upon boarding the connection bus another 30 mins delayed. By this time it was about 10pm. Obviously missed the connecting flight to Sydney so tried to find a BA contact in terminal 4. Was then advised to go to terminal 1. No BA reps around and no 24 hr phone number. Then transferred to terminal 5. By this time it was midnight and still no BA contacts. Finally went to baggage services and saw a BA rep that had no idea what was going on and sent us to the first class lounge which was closed. Finally someone appeared at 1am who sorted out our hotel room and as the delay was caused by BA they provided us with the option of flying back to Sydney on BA or could see if they could get us on a China Southern flight (we had originally booked China Southern). We took the BA option as it was easiest and needed to come home. Next day arrived at airport and boarded through Gate C in terminal 5 (hate Heathrow airport). Lounge in Heathrow was fine over crowded but fine. Upon boarding the BA business class product we were very disappointed to say the least. Seats old aircraft old and the seating configuration was awful. We had the two middle seats E and F which were facing backwards however the seats on opposite sides are very close facing towards you. Flight left on time and arrived in Singapore on time. There was a delay of an hour in Singapore but again that couldn't be helped. They were also out of the express passes which was annoying and also lost our baggage - luckily it arrived two days later. Good luck if you're expecting to sleep on the flight. Seats were small and very uncomfortable. The amenity kits were ok however they ran out of eye masks. The hit towels were anything but hot. Food was below average. Overall I wouldn't recommend British Airways Club Europe/world. The best I've experienced so far from Sydney to Europe would have to be on China Southern. Considering they are 2-3 grand cheaper than British Airways and they offer a better business class product and a more seamless transfer process.
3716,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,3,True,"Boeing 767 Club Europe to Istanbul and back. The seats were tatty and very worn leg room limited at best thankfully the passenger in front on both legs did not recline their seats. The head rests are hanging off as are parts of the cabin. The food was ok but turning out a ""plastic pot"" upside down into the china bowl in front of you isn't that great. Even though I know they do that in the galley in first class it doesn't need to be on display. Crew much better inbound."
3726,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,3,False,"San Diego return business class (the seat was more comfortable than the first class one). As usual plane was fine service was OK but not attentive (i.e just about OK). Food was terrible -I have flown BA in economy business and first - and never had good or adequate quality food. If they upped their game on this they would be unbeatable. Entertainment pretty dire - at least first had a few good ""box sets"" of TV programmes. My wife was back in economy - her comment was that the world traveller plus seat gave her backache - the economy seat was better. Her food was inedible."
3728,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,3,False,Recently returned from Mauritius to Gatwick in Club World and have to say that the service was woefully lacking. Left on time. The cabin crew were obviously tired and the welcome glass of Champagne was served without smiles or a welcome. Throughout the whole flight the crew did the absolute minimum and there was very little interaction with the passengers. Breakfast was disgusting and served soon after take-off. A little round casserole dish of British Breakfast ingredients all piled together and searingly hot and overcooked and tasteless. Awful insipid coffee. After that some of the crew disappeared for a sleep and we were left to ourselves. Nobody asked if we wanted anything nobody chatted I rang for a drink and nobody came. The galley 'kitchen/snack bar' was almost bare and had two manky stale smoked-salmon sandwiches and a few bottles of water. On asking for a glass (there were none) for wine I was told to sit down and one would be brought as indeed it was ten minutes later with no smiles or nibbles. Throughout the flight I felt guilty asking for a G&T or wine because of the negative attitude of certain cabin crew. Lunch was just about OK and very good wine. After that for the next five hours nothing was served to refresh us before landing - no tea no cakes no nothing. The seating configuration was 2-4-2 (Boeing 777) and packed in like sardines - claustrophobic for some. To access the aisle from the window you have to climb over the legs of the person behind and the food is served across the lap of the aisle seat over the partition. We were a couple but if you are travelling alone it could make for some very strange eye-to-eye contact with a stranger. The IFE was dated and a very limited choice with poor quality fuzzy screens. The whole package was so minimal soulless and lacking. Not once were you made to feel special or 'pampered' in any way. If there is an alternative in future to BA I'll take it and compared with some Middle-East airlines the Club World product is embarrassingly mediocre. BA needs to refresh review and up-date quickly. Sorry BA - you've lost me for the foreseeable future!
3753,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,False,I have just been reviewing all the reviews on this website and it seems every evident to me that if you are booked in First class you will more than lightly have a great flight economy or premium is touch and go! If you want to take the risk I travel BA to Tampa premium economy three times a year the food is disgusting and I always sit in aisle 14 now if anyone has booked there seat in this aisle be warned they run out of choices on the menu when they get to you and they offer you an economy meal and quite frankly they do not care if you complain well I complained! Myself and the man seated next to me kept up the complaining and 15 mins later the steward comes up with two beef dishes. The crew had kept these meals for themselves. So be aware that if you are seated in aisle 14 bring your own food because you will not get a decent meal.
3754,False,,Australia,,,1.0,1,False,I flew Singapore to Sydney with them recently and it was the most horrible flying experience. At the boarding gate the staff were just so disorganised in getting the passengers on board that we had to wait for almost an hour before we got on. The plane was an old and tired 747-400 which had the dirtiest cabin I have seen. There was a stale smell lingering in the premium economy cabin. The seats were old worn out and lumpy despite being in premium economy. The inflight entertainment was a joke. The video quality was mediocre and the noise cancelling headphones were not working for most of the flight. The food was some strange fried rice which was bland. The crew were unfriendly they didn't serve drinks once throughout the flight. The worst part were the toilets smelly with a toilet bowl and sink choked with toilet paper. Overall I will never fly British Airways again unless I don't have any choice.
3770,False,,Ireland,,,2.0,3,True,Flew return in CW from LHR to BKK in August 2012. The positives of both flights were: they were on time seats were comfortable and lounges were good. The negatives were: very poor food selections on board (over cooked and uninspiring) very mixed crews - depending on what side of the aircraft you sat you got a totally different in-flight experience - some of the cabin crew should get new jobs as passengers are a severe inconvenience to them and the IFE was unreliable - on both flights the IFE had to be re-set at least once. Overall the flights were fine and I will use BA again if the price is right.
3772,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,2,False,Business LHR to BKK. 747-400. First try back with BA in about 5 years during which I have flown many other airlines and been impressed with most. The only things that impress me with BA are the staff and their ability to pretend this is a quality airline and the fact that people pay BA so much money to be treated like cattle. The Food is without doubt some of the worst I have had in Business anywhere poorly presented badly prepared and barely edible. The AVOD looks like it was installed 10 years ago and then wasn't the top of the range screen size is terrible viewing angles and resolution poor. The seats work well as a lie flat configuration. That's the highlight. I cant help feel that if BA senior managers occasionally used their own money to fly with rivals then we would see real change from our national flag carrier. Regretting my already booked return flight and my 550000 BA air miles.
